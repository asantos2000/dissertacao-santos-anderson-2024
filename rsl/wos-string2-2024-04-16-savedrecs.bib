Abstract = {We conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment with 318 finance professionals
   to investigate the effects of incentives on misconduct in the finance
   industry. We examine the inclusion of compliance, as well as transaction
   volumes, for determining performance pay. This is proposed by regulators
   to reduce misconduct, despite the inherent difficulty of measuring
   compliance. Relative to fixed remuneration, the performance pay
   structures that incorporate compliance measures produce significantly
   worse compliance outcomes with mixed results in terms of productivity
   gains. Anticipating relative peer information on both criteria leads to
   increased productivity; the number of participants choosing to
   consistently comply remains unchanged, but those who sometimes violate
   policy are less compliant.},

Abstract = {Innovation in Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to produce a wealth
   of techniques, mostly coming from the inductive form of AI also known as
   Machine Learning (ML). The majority of NIL algorithms is
   industry-neutral and business process agnostic. ML innovation is
   propelled by publicly available research, which gets harvested into Open
   Source for wide distribution through software and Cloud vendors.
   Ongoing Al technology work creates an immense source of assets for
   data-driven modeling, delivered as software libraries. However, the
   application of these assets for data monetization in finance does not
   happen with nearly comparable success or speed. The latter challenge is
   commonly known as the ``scalability problem of AI{''}. As new techniques
   continue to grow vigorously, the investment from large finance
   institutions to cost-effectively produce applications for a variety of
   lines-of-business (LoBs) and business processes will increase. The
   availability of ML capabilities on Public (loud is a way for enterprises
   to increase productivity by benefiting from the best AI assets available
   from providers and startups. But data is constrained in terms of
   location, access and use in most finance competences by either laws or
   internal Governance, Risk and Compliance (CRC) rules. Legal limitations
   include, and go beyond, Privacy Acts, impacting non-retail processes
   where AI techniques must be explained in layperson language to
   decision-makers and regulators before field deployment. The latter is
   not yet achieved satisfactorily. Lastly, a large percentage of AI
   projects fail, in part due to unsuitable ML modeling for analytics and
   forecasting problems in finance. The variety and complexity of human
   behavior present in most finance processes calls for understanding AI at
   a level of cognitive depth that has no precedent in other industries. It
   is imperative that AI be approached so that finance competence and
   functional specificity are embedded a-priori into ML techniques and not
   as use-case afterthoughts. For acceleration of AI assessments, it is
   critical that ML techniques available in software implement models
   readily aligned to finance problems.
   This paper presents an approach to building an Architecture for
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Finance by focusing on analytics and
   forecasting for business-to-business operations. This AI Architecture
   hinges on three axes and their interplay: Design Dimensions, Modeling
   Building-Blocks and Work-Practice. The goal is to support finance
   practitioners navigate the plethora of AI . options more effectively and
   accelerate data monetization. While ML techniques in data analytics and
   forecasting apply to many scenarios, this paper focuses on selected
   competences in Banking, Financial Markets and Chief Finance Officer
   (CFO) operations.
   The architecture and method introduced in this paper is a first step
   toward a service practice. We harvest from our work carried out in
   banks, asset management firms and CEO lines-of-business as well as R\&D
   experiences in new finance technologies for over one decade. As with any
   other architecture and deployment methodology, this work requires
   further harvesting, more information technology tools and sharing
   experiences across practitioners. It is hoped that finance organizations
   could adopt these new capabilities in their own Centers of Excellence or
   other internal organizations leading data-driven transformation and
   monetization across the firm.},

Abstract = {In today's business conditions, where business activities are spreading
   over a wide geographical area, fraud auditing processes have crucial
   importance especially for the retailing sector which has a high branch
   network. In the retailing sector, especially purchasing processes are
   subject to high fraud risks. This paper shows that it is possible to
   detect fraudulent processes by applying data mining techniques on
   operational data related to purchasing activities. Within this scope, in
   order to detect the fraudulent purchasing operations, support vector
   machine (SVM) models with different kernels and artificial neural
   networks methods have been used and successful results have been
   achieved. The results of the two methods have been examined
   comparatively and it shows that optimized SVM classifier outperforms
   others. Besides, in this study, it is presumed that the detected fraud
   data can be proactively used in the struggle against fraud with
   fraud-governance risk and compliance software by converting it into
   scenario analysis.},

Title = {Time for a paradigm change: Problems with the financial industry's
   approach to operational risk},
Journal = {RISK ANALYSIS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 26},
Abstract = {Organizational and risk cultures in the financial industry are argued to
   be the root cause of banking problems. It is concerning that financial
   regulators and practitioners still consider the industry to be seriously
   fragile in several respects, particularly to operational risks and risks
   associated with digital transformation and innovation-not that the risks
   of organizational misconduct have disappeared. The rescue of Credit
   Suisse in 2023 confirms this. This paper employs extant theories of
   organizational culture, learning, and action to critically evaluate the
   existing risk paradigm in banking and to highlight its deficiencies,
   which practitioners can only address by questioning the flawed
   assumptions and dysfunctional values and behaviors found to be endemic
   in banks. However, business and risk practitioners are also married to
   institutional approaches that focus on assessing risk and measuring
   historical losses to allocate regulatory capital, rather than
   forward-looking approaches to measure and manage risk. This requires a
   paradigm change. This paper presents a novel risk measurement and
   accounting methodology, Risk Accounting, to help underpin such change.
   Risk accounting measures risk exposure in quantitative and qualitative
   terms and can be implemented using an AI-enabled digital architecture
   that could solve endemic problems with risk data aggregation and
   analysis. Significantly, risk accounting enables a financial value to be
   placed on risk exposures at a granular level. This level of transparency
   provides an incentive to change behaviors in banks and support cultural
   change while providing a basis for a paradigm change in the way
   operational risk is managed.},

Abstract = {We evaluate a novel regulation designed to address ongoing risk
   management failures: Australia's Banking Executive Accountability Regime
   (BEAR). This mixed methods study draws on a survey and 41 interviews
   with accountable persons and their reports across 15 organisations.
   Consistent with theory and previous experimental research, the study
   demonstrates the benefits of enhanced accountability for promoting more
   diligent `system 2' behaviour. We provide evidence that BEAR promotes
   greater felt accountability among senior executives which in turn
   stimulates more proactive and diligent risk management behaviour. This
   behaviour has the potential to attenuate many of the behavioural biases
   associated with risk management failures.},

Abstract = {Robotic process automation is rapidly transforming the world of work for
   accounting and other information professionals. Data collection and
   entry that used to occupy much of the workday is being automated by
   programmable software robots or bots. Automation using bots should begin
   with processes that are stable, repetitive, and consume sufficient
   resources to generate a solid return on investment. As bots are
   implemented, a number of governance, risk, and compliance issues need to
   be considered including appropriate controls on bot access to sensitive
   records and transactions. The bot development process also requires
   controls so that only tested and authorized bots are deployed. For many
   companies, RPA is exactly what they have been looking for to drive
   higher efficiency in information processing.},

Title = {The Role of Risk Climate and Ethical Self-interest Climate in Predicting
   Unethical Pro-organisational Behaviour},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {173},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Unethical pro-organisational behaviour (UPB) is an ongoing concern,
   prompting the need for more nuanced understanding of the workplace
   environment most likely to inhibit it. This study considers the role of
   risk climate, sometimes referred to as risk culture, as well as ethical
   climate, for reducing UPB. The study investigates whether four risk
   climate factors (avoidance, valued, proactive and manager) can, by
   focusing on the long-term consequences of UPB to the organisation, and
   providing guidance on behavioural norms, reduce UPB misconduct.
   Surveying employees in three financial institutions we found that only
   one of the risk climate factors, avoidance, is consistently associated
   with UPB. On the other hand, a self-interested, (un)ethical climate
   significantly increases UPB in all samples. In multi-climate analysis,
   we found that risk climate factors interacted with ethical climate to
   predict UPB. That is, when employees perceive that the workplace ethos
   is not self-interested, three factors of risk climate-avoidance,
   proactive and manager-significantly predict UPB. UPB is least likely
   when self-interest is low, avoidance risk climate is low, proactive risk
   climate is high and manager risk climate is high. Implications for
   leaders are discussed.},

Abstract = {A growing number of information privacy breaches resulting in financial
   and reputational damage to organizations as well as individuals' anxiety
   regarding the misuse of one's personal information emphasize the need
   for a rigid organizational information privacy initiative. An
   interesting proposition is the integration of organizational information
   privacy protection in a Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) context.
   GRC is a novel and multifaceted means to an approach, whereby risk and
   compliance are regarded as strategic initiatives that link to the
   business objectives. This in turn requires corporate governance to
   foster the growth and performance of the organization.
   This paper proposes a structural and navigational method for integrated
   organizational information privacy protection. This is done by means of
   using a conceptual framework that was previously constructed by
   incorporating identified information privacy protection elements within
   an existing GRC frame of reference. This paper seeks to update the
   conceptual framework that was initially constructed for information
   privacy protection to organizational information privacy protection. The
   focus of this paper is how accountable organizations should protect the
   personal information of individual's and the framework is therefore
   adapted to organizational information privacy protection. The objective
   of this paper is to use the process component of the updated conceptual
   framework to construct a structural and navigational method for
   organizational information privacy protection.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the most formative
   technologies of the century and further gains importance to solve the
   big societal challenges (e.g. achievement of the sustainable development
   goals) or as a means to stay competitive in today's global markets. The
   role as a key enabler in many areas of our daily life leads to a growing
   dependence, which has to be managed accordingly to mitigate negative
   economic, societal or privacy impacts. Therefore, the European Union is
   working on an AI Act, which defines concrete governance, risk and
   compliance (GRC) requirements. One of the key demands of this regulation
   is the operation of a risk management system for High-Risk AI systems.
   In this paper, we therefore present a detailed analysis of relevant
   literature in this domain and introduce our proposed approach for an AI
   Risk Management System (AIRMan).},
