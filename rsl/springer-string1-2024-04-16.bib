	abstract = {In modern software development, much time is devoted and much attention is paid to the activity of data modeling and the translation of data models into databases. This has motivated the proposal of different approaches and tools to support this activity, such as semiautomatic approaches that generate data models from requirements artifacts using text analysis and sets of heuristics, among other techniques. However, these approaches still suffer from important limitations, including the lack of support for requirements traceability, the poor support for detecting and solving conflicts in domain-specific requirements, and the considerable effort required for manually checking the generated models. This paper introduces DataMock, an Agile approach that enables the iterative building of data models from requirements specifications, while supporting traceability and allowing inconsistencies detection in data requirements and specifications. The paper also describes how the approach effectively allows improving traceability and reducing errors and effort to build data models in comparison with traditional, state-of-the-art, data modeling approaches.},

Therefore, various approaches have been proposed in research and practice to partially or fully automate the creation of business process models. We conducted a systematic literature review (LR) on automatic generation of business process models. The LR demonstrates that there exist various approaches for automated generation of business process models, which differ in terms of the input data, generation methods, and modeling languages utilized. Despite active research into automatic model generation, there is still considerable scope for improvement. New technologies are continually being developed to support automatic model generation. Additionally, the increasing digitalization of processes and organizations generates vast amounts of data that can be harnessed for modeling.},

Such traceability provides end-users access to source documents describing rules and facts that apply to users. This helps both users and developers ensure that how systems work aligns with documentation they derive from. Important features of Web standards include, links to document fragments, and links from not just concepts but assertions about them. In addition, a shared identifier infrastructure enables the integration of these functions of the document and Semantic Webs. We investigate how and to what degree conforming tools for existing standards can implement this communication between these layers. Analysis of how these standards and their applied components work here provides insight into what traceable business rule implementation requires in general. Our approach is to implement an illustrative scenario with standards to demonstrate their utility and provide insights into the issues involved. This scenario comes from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which related work often uses in examples of business rule implementation.},

	abstract = {Adaptive Case Management (ACM) empowers knowledge workers of any industry by utilizing their experience in the execution of business cases. It is designed to handle non-repetitive processes, where the course of actions has to be decided for each case individually, based on the assessment of the current situation. ACM uses domain-specific data and the analysis of rules to provide the relevant information at the right time to the business users. This supports their actions and decision making but does not dictate predefined workflows that are difficult or even impossible to define for knowledge-intensive work and prevent users from efficiently achieving their goals. Solutions for ACM implementations need to focus on business requirements to support business users rather than limit them by extending existing tools such as content management systems, BPM-based software suites, or collaboration tools with ad hoc development that all lack the ability to adapt flexibly to business level changes without requiring significant IT development efforts. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach by applying business architecture concepts for the definition of ACM applications in combination with domain-specific ontologies and business rules. Business domain analysts describe with the domain-specific ontology the complete value stream with its goals, activities and rules which use a formalized natural business language. The resulting business information model is mapped to an underlying data model and instantly enacted during case execution so that adaptations get immediately available to the business users. The behavioral business rules guide business users to guarantee case compliance which facilitates an easy and rapid adaptation of business applications. We apply this approach to a real life example from the construction industry where several parties from different trades have to collaborate in heterogeneous environments.},

To face massive competition in which SMEs compete with well established corporates, organizations tend to focus on their core businesses while delegating other tasks to their partners. Lately, Blockchain technology has yet furthered and eased the way companies collaborate in a trust-less environment. As such, interest in researching process collaborations models and techniques has been growing. However, in contrast to BPM research for intra-organizational processes, where a multitude of process models repositories exist as a support for simulation and work evaluation, the lack of such repositories in the context of inter-organizational processes has become an inconvenience. The aim of this paper is to build a repository of collaborative process models that will assist the research in this area. A top-down approach is used to automatically generate constrained and compliant choreography models, from which public and private process models are derived. Though the generation is partly random, it complies to a predefined set of compliance rules and parameters specified by the user.},

	abstract = {In declarative process models all the activities which do not violate a constraint of the process model can be executed. Consequently, the number of viable paths is large. In turn, when considering multiple perspectives during execution, i.e., constraints on resources and data values, it may happen that the execution of activities or the change of data values may result in the non-executability of crucial activities. Execution engines for single-perspective declarative process models have been extensively discussed in research where, among others look-ahead functionality has been investigated. Execution approaches for multi-perspective declarative models that involve constraints on data and resources, however, are less mature. In this paper, we introduce a logic based look-ahead approach for the execution of multi-perspective declarative processes. We use the look-ahead for simulating a fixed number of execution steps with regard to the existing trace and the choice of the next step. The look-ahead allows for estimating all consequences and effects of certain decisions at any time of process execution. We develop an algorithm for trace generation and checking traces using the logic language Alloy. We extensively evaluate our approach by means of a practical example and give some advice for further optimizations.},

It is based on a meta-model with roots on formal first-order logic. In order to create valid business vocabulary and rules, based on this standard, business analysts need tools that can facilitate modeling efforts using the standard. In this work, we contribute with a proposed tool that would allow business analyst designers to define the keywords that represent each of the Logical Formulation Concepts in the SBVR Meta-model. Therefore, this approach would enable the creation of Controlled Natural Language Libraries based on the SBVR meta-model that can be dynamically included in SBVR Modeling projects. These Language Libraries can then be used to model business rules and vocabularies in the tool. As a result, one can support multiple controlled natural languages and represent the SBVR metamodel using the tool. Examples of different controlled natural languages using the proposed SBVR editor tool are provided.},

Such experts are often not acquainted with the low-level technologies used to actually execute these rules and will hence document them in some informal form, such as in natural language. In order to execute these rules, they need to be transformed by technical experts into a relevant executable language, such as SQL. The technical experts in turn are often not familiar with the business logic these rules are depicting and will thusly have to collaborate with the business experts to gain insight into the semantics of the rules. This paper presents an approach for writing financial data validation rules in constrained natural language, that can then be automatically transformed and executed against the data they are referring to. In order to achieve this, we use the Xtext framework for creating the editor where business experts can create their rules that can then be transformed into executable constraints. We evaluate this approach in terms of its extensibility, coverage and verboseness with respect to the business rules sent to specific UK banks submitting data under one of the Bank of England’s annual reviews.},

	abstract = {The research for solutions for compliance is mainly focused on the representation of regulative rules, i.e. the imperatives that the industry is asked to comply to. Yet, a relevant part of the legal knowledge contained in regulation cannot be expressed in terms of deontic statements, and is instead represented as constitutive rules. This concept was first introduced by philosophers of language such as J.L. Austin and J.R. Searle and further developed in legal philosophy, where constitutive statements are classified in categories according to their legal effects. The present paper presents a heuristic approach for the representation of alethic statements as part of a methodology aimed at ensuring effective translation of the regulatory text into a machine-readable language. The approach is based on a classification of constitutive statements contained in the work of legal philosophers A.G. Conte and G. Carcaterra. The methodology includes an intermediate language, accompanied by an XML persistence model, and introduces a set of “legal concept patterns” to specifically represent the different constitutive statements. The paper identifies five patterns for the corresponding constitutive statements found in financial regulations: legal definitions, commencement rules, amendments, relative necessities, and party to the law statements.},

Declarative process models allow flexible process executions that are restricted by constraints. Execution engines for declarative process models have been extensively investigated in research with a strong focus on behavioral aspects. However, execution approaches for multi-perspective declarative models that involve constraints on data values and resource assignments are still not existing. In this paper, we present an approach for the execution of multi-perspective declarative process models in order to close this gap. The approach builds on a classification strategy for different constraint types evaluating their relevance in different execution contexts. For execution, all constraints are transformed into the execution language Alloy that is used to solve satisfiability (SAT) problems. We implemented a modeling tool including the transformation functionality and the process execution engine itself. The approach has been evaluated in terms of expressiveness and efficiency.},

	abstract = {In the early phases of software development, both of business analysts and IT architects collaborate to define the business needs in a consistent and unambiguous format before exploiting them to produce a software solution to the problem have been defined. Given the divergence of the interest areas of each intervenor, the natural language remains the most adequate format to define the business needs in order to avoid misunderstanding. This informal support suffers from ambiguity leading to inconsistencies, which will affect the reliability of the final solution. Accordingly, the Object Management Group (OMG) has proposed the “Semantic Business Vocabulary and Rules” (SBVR) standard which offers the opportunity to gather business rules in a natural language format having a formal logic aspect, letting the possibility to be understood by not only the different stakeholders but also directly processed by the machine. Since the SBVR standard is born to represent business rules by combining business vocabulary, it would be wise to give a great attention to the latter. In this paper we present an approach to extract business vocabulary according to SBVR Structured English as one of possibly notation that can map to the SBVR Meta-Model, with a view to provide a relevant resource for the next software deployment steps.},

Class diagram describe the structure of the system and responsibilities. OCL is a language that defines rules that apply on class model. For matching the OCL (Object Constraints Language) to class model we need SBVR tool because SBVR is generated from system’s constraints. If OCL invariants and SBVR vocabulary is different than there is major error exist in software. SBVR (Symantec Business Verification Rules) tool provide SBVR vocabulary and that vocabulary and OCL elements are used for matching. However, manual matching not only difficult but it is time consuming and costly. This paper provides automated approach that checks automatically system constraints (that is written in OCL) using business rules (that is written in SBVR (Symantec Business Verification Rules)). This approach can help to check efficiently SBVR rules and OCL constraints and consume less time and effort.},

The negative aspects of pragmatics is due to the difficulty involved in separating their concerns. When representing a legal norm for (semi-)automated reasoning, an important step/aspect is the annotation of legal sections under consideration. Annotation in the context of this paper refers to identification, segregation and thereafter representation of the content and its associated context. In this paper we present an approach and provide a proof-of-concept implementation for automatizing the process of identifying the most relevant judgment pertaining to a legal section and further transforming them into a formal representation format. The annotated legal section and its related judgments can then be mapped into a decision model for further down the line processing.},

In light of the, now enforced EU-wide, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) we present an automatic technique for mapping privacy policies excerpts to relevant GDPR articles so as to support average users in understanding their usage risks and rights as a data subject. KnIGHT (Know your rIGHTs), is a tool that finds candidate sentences in a privacy policy that are potentially related to specific articles in the GDPR. The approach employs semantic text matching in order to find the most appropriate GDPR paragraph, and to the best of our knowledge is one of the first automatic attempts of its kind applied to a company’s policy. Our evaluation shows that on average between 70–90\% of the tool’s automatic mappings are at least partially correct, meaning that the tool can be used to significantly guide human comprehension. Following this result, in the future we will utilize domain-specific vocabularies to perform a deeper semantic analysis and improve the results further.},

Whilst decision models already help with modeling, implementing and automating decisions, the modelling step would still benefit from a (semi)-automated approach. The introduction of ChatGPT and GPT-3 offers opportunities to automatically discover decision dependencies from a given text. This paper evaluates the performance of two approaches that automatically extract decision dependencies from text, namely the best performing version of GPT-3 with a BERT-based approach. An evaluation with 36 experiments with a dataset of real-life cases and various levels of creativity allowed for GPT-3 concludes that theBERT BERT-based approach outperforms GPT-3 on the real-life dataset but that GPT-3 has promising results and requires further investigation.},

Then, an XML parser is used to parse the xml file and extract the BPMN and UML class elements which will further be verified. Proposed approach will overcome all the inconsistencies in case of modification within existing BPMN models which can enhance the effectiveness of any business process models. Business process exist in a business organization. Bank, open bank account, cheque cash, check balance at ATM, etc. Customer requirements vary with respect of time, then we have to update and improve, refine business processes. The frequent changes in business processes may make them inconsistent with respect to other business process. Such inconsistencies create problems in business activities. It is difficult to identify such inconsistencies manually due to involvement of lot of effort and time. There should be an automated approach or an automated tool that can help in identifying the possible inconsistencies in business processes after changes.},

To overcome these shortcomings, this work aims at deriving mixed graphs based on paragraph embedding as well as process discovery and combining these graphs using constraint relations such as “redundant” or “conflicting” detected by the ConRelMiner method. The approach is implemented and evaluated based on two real-world use cases: Austria’s energy use cases plus the contained process models as ground truth and the GDPR.

Previous research in the field of compliance has established that the manual specification/tagging of the regulations not only fails to ensure their proper coverage but also negatively affects the turnaround time both in proving and maintaining the compliance. Our contribution in this paper is a case study using a subset of European Union Regulation in the financial markets, namely, Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR) and that we validated it in the context of our model-driven semi-automated compliance framework. The novelty of the framework is the key participation of domain experts to author regulatory rules in a controlled natural language to enable compliance checking. We demonstrate transformation of regulations present in legal natural language text (English) to a model form via authoring of Structured English rules in the context of MMSR regulations for a large European bank. This generated regulatory model is eventually translated to formal logic that enables formal compliance checking contrary to current industry practice, that provides content management-based, document-driven and expert-dependent ways of managing regulatory compliance.},

              Background
              
                Conventional calibration of the gamma camera consists of the calculation of calibration factors (CFs) (ratio of counts/cc and true concentration activity) as the function of the volume of interest (VOI). However, such method shows inconsistent results when the background activity varies. The aim of the present study was to propose a new calibration method by considering the sphere-to-background counts/voxel ratio (SBVR) in addition to the VOI for CFs calculation. A PET cylindrical flood phantom, a NEMA IQ body phantom, a Data spectrum Torso Phantom (ECT/TOR/P) and a LK-S Kyoto Liver/Kidney phantom were used. The NEMA IQ phantom was used to calibrate the camera and to produce CFs for the different spheres volumes and for varying sphere-to-background activity ratios. The spheres were filled with a uniform activity concentration of
                177
                Lu, while the background was first filled with cold water and activity was added between each SPECT scan. SPECT imaging was performed for 30-s, 20-s, and 10-s exposure per view. The calculated CFs were expressed as function of the sphere volume and SBVR. The obtained CFs were validated for an additional NEMA IQ acquisition with different activities in spheres and background and for the Torso and Liver/Kidney phantoms with inserted NEMA IQ spheres. The quantification accuracy was compared with the conventional method not taking SBVR into consideration.
              
            
            
              Results
              The relative errors in quantification using the NEMA IQ phantom with the new calibration method were 0.16\%, 5.77\%, 9.34\% for the large, medium and small sphere, respectively, for a time per view of 30-s. The conventional calibration method gave errors of 3.65\%, 6.65\%, 30.28\% for 30-s. The LK-S Kyoto Liver/Kidney Phantom resulted in quantification errors of 3.40\%, 2.14\%, 11.18\% for the large, medium and small spheres, respectively, for 30-s; compared to 11.31\%, 17.54\%, 14.43\% for 30-s, respectively, for the conventional method. Similar results were obtained for shorter acquisitions times with 20-s and 10-s time per view.
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                These results suggest that SBVR allows to improve quantification accuracy. The shorter time-per-view acquisitions had similar relative differences compared to the full-time acquisition which allows shorter imaging times with
                177
                Lu and improved patient comfort. The SBVR method is simple to set up and can be proposed for standardization.},

              Background
              
                Image-based tumor dosimetry after radionuclide therapy, using the isotope
                177
                Lu, finds application e.g., for tumor-to-organ dose comparison and for dose response evaluation. When the tumor extent is not much larger than the image resolution, and when
                177
                Lu is found in nearby organs or other tumors, an accurate determination of tumor dose is particularly challenging. Here a quantitative evaluation of three different methods for determining the
                177
                Lu activity concentration in a phantom is performed, and the dependence on a variety of parameters is described. The phantom (NEMA IEC body phantom) has spheres of different size in a background volume, and sphere-to-background
                177
                Lu activity concentration ratios of infinity, 9.5, 5.0 and 2.7 are applied. The methods are simple to implement and well-known from the literature. They are based on (1) a large VOI encompassing the whole sphere, without background activity and with volume information from other sources, (2) a small VOI located in the sphere center, and (3) a VOI consisting of voxels with voxel value above a certain percentage of the maximum voxel value.
              
            
            
              Results
              The determined activity concentration varies significantly with sphere size, sphere-to-background ratio, SPECT reconstruction method and method for determining the concentration. Based on the phantom study, criteria are identified under which the activity concentration can be determined with a maximal error of 40\% even in the presence of background activity.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Tumor dosimetry is feasible in the presence of background activity using the above-mentioned methods, provided appropriate SPECT reconstructions are applied and tumors are selected for dosimetry analysis according to the following criteria for the three methods: (1) solitary tumor with diameter {\textgreater} 15 mm, (2) tumor diameter {\textgreater} 30 mm and tumor-to-background ratio {\textgreater} 2, and (3) tumor diameter {\textgreater} 30 mm and tumor-to-background ratio {\textgreater} 3.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Declarative process modelling languages focus on describing a process by restrictions over the behaviour, which must be satisfied throughout the whole process execution. Hence, they are well suited for modelling knowledge-intensive processes with many decision points. However, such models can be hard to read and understand, which affect the modelling and maintenance of the process models tremendously as well as their execution. When executing such declarative (multi-perspective) process models, it may happen that the execution of activities or the change of data values may result in the non-executability of crucial activities. Hence, it would be beneficial to know all consequences of decisions to give recommendations to the process participants. A look-ahead attempts to predict the effects of executing an activity towards possible consequences within an a priori defined time window. The prediction is based on the current state of the process execution, the intended next event and the underlying process model. While execution engines for single-perspective imperative process models already implement such functionality, execution approaches, for multi-perspective declarative process models that involve constraints on data and resources, are less mature. In this paper, we introduce a simulation-based look-ahead approach for multi-perspective declarative process models. This approach transforms the problem of a context-aware process simulation into a SAT problem, by translating a declarative multi-perspective process model and the current state of a process execution into a specification of the logic language Alloy. Via a SAT solver, process trajectories are generated that either satisfy or violate this specification. The simulated process trajectories are used to derive consequences and effects of certain decisions at any time of process execution. We evaluate our approach by means of three examples and give some advice for further optimizations.},

Nevertheless, the question of how exactly to become fully compliant by adhering to all necessary laws and regulations remains. This paper presents a human-centred, knowledge-driven approach to regulatory reporting. A given regulation is represented in a controlled natural language form including its metadata and bindings, with the assistance of subject matter experts. This representation of a semi-formal controlled natural language translates into a self-executable formal representation via a context-free grammar. A meta reasoner with the knowledge to execute the given self-executable formal representation while generating regulatory reports including explanations on derived results has been developed. Finally, the proposed approach has been implemented as a prototype and validated in the realm of financial regulation: Money Market Statistical Reporting Regulation.},

Semantic business vocabulary and rules are the standards from object management group for the business organization to form the polices and rules. On the based of these rules business organization develop different software from software industry to make transaction globally. But these rules are complex and ambiguous, cause misunderstanding and miscommunication for the software developer. Our used approach give the solution of this problem, to make a representation of semantic vocabulary and rules in form of referent graph, visual representation of these rules.},

Such editors only offer basic support such as grammar spelling. They do not check compliance of business rules with a business glossary or more complex artifacts, e.g. domain diagrams. The goal of this paper is to propose a method of compatibility checking of business rules expressed in natural language with the domain specification. Checking is done at the syntax level. It is assumed that the domain is specified by a class diagram and a glossary. The compatibility checking is a heuristic method, the usefulness of which has been demonstrated by several experiments. At that point, the method application is limited to business rules relating to at most two classes and/or two attributes/roles.},

It has been observed that unexpected messages exchanged occur in service choreographies when rule-based choreography specification (the SBVR model) involves the logical operator. This paper concerns about the unexpected circumstances in the service interaction when applying inclusive disjunction, OR in the SBVR rules specifications. The SBVR rules define the choreography specifications through the construction of a logical formulation consisting of atomic formulations, modality, logical operations, and quantification. The role binding of logical formulation and the “Sets” definition according to the OMG standard are applied to the SBVR model for service choreographies.

SBVR Bridge the gap between humans and machines as human can understand simple natural language sentences while this natural language has ambiguous nature for machine and IT specialists. The VeTIS tool is used for the transformation purpose. SBVR rules generated as first output and these rules gave as input to transaction editor that extract SBVR vocabulary such as noun concept, fact type etc. In the last step these SBVR elements are replaced by elements that are called tags of XML vocabulary.},

The inherit ambiguity of the latter is often seen as a cause for project failure, which makes it necessary to translate natural language business rules statements to another language sufficiently formal. However, business experts are generally not familiar with formal languages, which can complicate the communication between stakeholders. For this reason, Object Management Group (OMG) had proposed SBVR Standard (2008) for modeling complex organizations in a natural language but in a formal and detailed way. As a result, several studies have succeeded to increase the accuracy of their approaches by transforming their models from/to SBVR standard. Clearly then, the success of these approaches depends on the quality of the SBVR based statements used or generated.

This paper introduces an improved requirement engineering technique based on CRC models that can help in specifying and analyzing software requirements in a better and faster way and curtailing difficulties associated with the traditional RE analysis technique. The proposed technique employs Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) to capture and specify software requirements in a controlled natural language. The SBVR representation is processed to extract object-oriented information and map the extracted information to CRC models in both textual and visual form. The proposed approach is implemented as an Eclipse plugin prototype SBVR2CRC as a proof of concept and the results of the experiments validate the effectiveness of the presented approach. Results show that such automated approach not only saves certain time and effort but also assists in generation of better CRC models and simplifies the CRC models based agile software development.},

Motivated by this problem, we introduce a Component-oriented synthetic textual requirements generator (CORG) that can generate large numbers of synthesised diverse-structure textual requirements, along with key components breakdowns. CORG utilises a controlled random-selection (CRS) strategy throughout the backtracking-based generation. We evaluate the coverage, diversity, performance and correctness of CORG.

This paper presents a situation viewpoint that can be used to extend stakeholder analysis in enterprise architecture framework with relationships to improve the understanding of why and how information products are used in constellations of stakeholders where each stakeholder plays a role. The situation viewpoint aims to improve the relevance, design, tailoring, effectiveness, evolution, and evaluation of information products such as models.},

A case study, which was chosen as a common background for the comparison, is an example of modeling problems characteristic for bioinformatics. First the OMG Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) standard was used to define the domain. The Association-Oriented Database (AODB) metamodel based approach was applied to show how the appropriate domain-specific model can be created in a graph modeling language dedicated to data modeling. In contrast, the Context-Driven Meta-Modeling (CDMM) approach, illustrates how to construct a domain-specific modeling language to model the case-study as a domain. The AODB is used as a General-Purpose Modeling Language (GPML) while the CDMM is applied as a Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML). Both approaches constitute alternatives for MOF based languages known from OMG standards.},

The solution is based on the business processes used internally in all participating organizations to collaborations with common business objectives. For un-standardized organizations, we used process mining techniques to formalize processes and to attach them to business scenarios. The process models are reduced to graph format and graph comparison algorithms are used to compute a compatibility factor. Syntactic similarity is unfeasible for real business process comparison in an un-standardized environment. Semantic similarity is resource consuming and could lead to un-predictable results. We propose in the current paper a methodology based on domain specific ontology to calculate the similarity between organizations from process perspective and to offer a collaborative solution, business process based.},

The aim of the study is to investigate the occurrence of cybersickness in the context of the customer’s perceived enjoyment and the perceived challenge of a VR product presentation. Based on a conceptual research framework, a laboratory study with 533 participants was conducted to determine the influence of these factors on the occurrence of cybersickness. The results demonstrate that the perceived challenge has a substantially stronger impact on the occurrence of cybersickness, which can only be partially reduced by perceived enjoyment. When realizing VR applications in general and VR product presentations in particular, e-commerce retailers should therefore first minimize possible challenges instead of focusing primarily on entertainment aspects of such applications.},

Hence there is an urgent need to design a framework that can help build domain knowledge of the business analyst (BA) involved in elicitation in order to lower dependence on SME. Such framework should be programmatically implementable and should be able to work seamlessly with the existing techniques of elicitation. Several solutions based on organizational theories, cognitive models, and strategic frameworks have been proposed with varying results. This work is in progress. As elicitation generates a web of interactions in natural language, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be utilized to extract and build domain knowledge. This paper investigates the application of NLP to extract working domain knowledge from the available organizational documents to assist analyst during elicitation phase. The paper proposes a conceptual framework to extract and build domain familiarity. This paper also analyzes the gaps and new areas of research in this direction.},

This paper describes a fully functioning framework and system for specifying and executing smart contracts in which the core logic is specified by a controlled English, business-level rules language. The framework includes a browser-based smart editor for rules; a parser generator that enables substantial variation in the rules syntax; code generation that maps to a RETE based rules engine; and execution of the rules in either on-chain (using Hyperledger Fabric) or off-chain modes.

We demonstrate our technique by applying it to the EU-Rent case. An existing EU-Rent implementation in the relation algebra-based system Ampersand serves as an example for restriction of input values and display parameters in the interface. Another existing EU-Rent implementation provides Semantic Web inferencing for rule logic. We apply our proposed inference patterns to this implementation.

One of the main motivations of software testing is to ensure the correctness of a software system. Thus, due to the continuous quest for better quality of software system, the efforts spent on testing phase are enormous and costly toward both the user and the developer. Many tools and approaches were proposed to solve this problem. Model-Based Testing (MBT) is one of the new technologies to meet the challenges imposed on software testing. Compared to traditional testing methods, MBT is able to manage and accomplish testing tasks in a cheaper and more efficient way. MBT relies on models of the system under test and/or its environment to derive test cases for the system. Models can be used in different manners and for different purposes such as improving specifications quality, code generation, and test generation. In this paper, we use models as the core element of our approach that aims to generate test cases for the different abstraction levels of MDA development life cycle. Our approach uses UML diagrams and Semantic Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) to model MDA levels then we propose transformations to generate test cases in order to evaluate if the generated code fulfills system requirements.

	abstract = {Data retrieval is a mandatory and universal process that is used by almost every digital deployment for their application-specific use cases. Researchers have developed various machine learning models to facilitate highly efficient, fast, low complexity, and multisource data retrieval techniques. But due to a wide variation in input data types there is a huge variation in deployment of these techniques. For instance, text retrieval techniques require estimation of distance metrics, while audio and image retrieval techniques require estimation of correlation metrics, and video retrieval techniques use recursive correlation for retrieval of video sequences. Furthermore, these strategies differ internally in terms of their qualitative and quantitative properties, making it challenging for researchers to find the best retrieval techniques for their application-specific use cases. For instance, audio and text retrieval models use 1D data representation and retrieval techniques, while image and video processing models use 2D, 3D \& 4D based techniques, which causes ambiguity in model selection for real-time use cases. This study describes some of the recently presented data retrieval strategies and evaluates their deployment-specific nuances, application-specific advantages, functional lacunas, and perspective future research objectives to lessen model selection uncertainty. Researchers will have the ability to discover retrieving models with higher functional capabilities for application-specific use cases as a result of this debate. The effectiveness of these models was then studied by comparing performance indicators such as retrieval delay, retrieval accuracy, computational overhead, scalability, and installation cost parameters. This text also proposes the evaluation of a novel Data Retrieval Metric (DRM), which combines these evaluation parameters, and assists in identification of high-performance models suited for large-scale deployments.},

Assurance cases are an emerging way of communicating safety of a safety-critical system in a structured and comprehensive manner. Due to the significant complexity of the required materials, software tools are often used as a practical way of constructing assurance cases. This paper presents the first, to the best of our knowledge, systematic review of assurance case tools. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive list of assurance case tools developed over the past 20 years and an analysis of their functionalities.},

The principles presented are deliberately worded for broad use and inspirational purposes, rather than worked out in detail.

These phases are also linked to several project problems and failure causes, delaying the project finalization and increasing its total cost. Several strategies to mitigate the effects of errors in these early stages have been proposed. Some of these include: GUI based fast prototyping; agile software development methodologies; and, as in this work, automatic model (or source code) generation from a natural language specification. Although these approaches can reduce production time and costs, they can also be slow and imprecise leading to development difficulties. This work proposes an approach to obtain a functional prototype of a web-based process-oriented information system, using only a restricted natural language specification as an input. This approach allows the processing of the input to be faster and more precise than the approaches proposed previously.

In this paper generation of UML diagrams from textual information using NLP is discussed with the concepts of deep learning. The proposed algorithm is able to identify the required objects, attributes, relationships, etc., which will be specified by the user for the preparation of UML diagrams. This is possible by the various generation principles. Initially generation of consolidated design model is acquired and from that the class model is derived.

To be legally substantiated, it requires that the formulæ express validly the legal meaning of the Regulation’s articles.

We devise such a validation methodology and exemplify it over a knowledge base of articles of the GDPR translated into Reified I/O (RIO) logic and encoded in LegalRuleML. A pivotal element of the methodology is a human-readable intermediate representation of the logic formulæ that preserves the formulæ’s meaning, while rendering it in a readable way to non-experts. After being applied over a use case, we prove that it is possible to retrieve feedback from legal experts about the formal representation of Art. 5.1a and Art. 7.1. What emerges is an agile process to build logic knowledge bases of legal texts, and to support their public trust, which we intend to use for a logic model of the GDPR, called DAPRECO knowledge base.},

In this paper, we propose an approach for socialization, language self-adaptation, and evolution that enables an effective communicative interaction among digital entities acting in a digital ecosystem. The proposed method relies on an adaptable and extensible grammatical formalism, named Digital Ecosystem Grammar (DEG). This grammar enables digital entities to interpret the messages sent by other entities by using interaction, learning and evolution actions. Moreover, a grammar learning algorithm is applied to provide the self-adaptation mechanisms that allow the digital environment to adapt the interaction language according to new messages. The approach was suitable to support the characteristics of self-adaptation, context-awareness, evolvability, and semanticity of a digital ecosystem language.},

	abstract = {Formalising deontic concepts, such as obligation, prohibition and permission, is normally carried out in a modal logic with a possible world semantics, in which some worlds are better than others. The main focus in these logics is on inferring logical consequences, for example inferring that the obligation O q is a logical consequence of the obligations Op and O (p → q). In this paper we propose a non-modal approach in which obligations are preferred ways of satisfying goals expressed in first-order logic. To say that p is obligatory, but may be violated, resulting in a less than ideal situation s, means that the task is to satisfy the goal p ∨ s, and that models in which p is true are preferred to models in which s is true. Whereas, in modal logic, the preference relation between possible worlds is part of the semantics of the logic, in this non-modal approach, the preference relation between first-order models is external to the logic. Although our main focus is on satisfying goals, we also formulate a notion of logical consequence, which is comparable to the notion of logical consequence in modal deontic logic. In this formalisation, an obligation Op is a logical consequence of goals G, when p is true in all best models of G. We show how this non-modal approach to the treatment of deontic concepts deals with problems of contrary-to-duty obligations and normative conflicts, and argue that the approach is useful for many other applications, including abductive explanations, defeasible reasoning, combinatorial optimisation, and reactive systems of the production system variety.},

	abstract = {Process mining is an emerging discipline that aims to analyze business processes using event data logged by IT systems. In process mining, the focus is on how to effectively and efficiently predict the next process/trace to be activated among all the possible processes/traces that are available in the process schema (usually modeled as a graph). Most of the existing process mining techniques assume that there is a one-to-one mapping between process model activities and the events that are recorded during process execution. However, event logs and process model activities are at different level of granularity. In this paper, we present a machine-learning-based approach to map low-level event logs to high-level activities. With this work, we can bridge the abstraction levels when the high-level labels of the low-level events are not available. The proposed approach consists of two main phases: automatic labeling and machine-learning-based classification. In automatic labeling, a modified k-prototypes clustering approach has been used in order to obtain the labeled examples. Then, in the second phase, we trained different ML classifiers using the obtained labeled examples. Since, in real-life applications and systems, business processes are expressed according to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) format, we improve our proposed framework by means of an innovative, flexible BPMN model translation methodology that acts at the first phase. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed framework using two case studies with real-world event logs, and provide its experimental assessment and analysis.},

Consequently, enterprise agility increasingly determines an enterprise’s chances for success. As software development often is a limiting factor in achieving enterprise agility, enterprise agility and software adaptability become increasingly intertwined. As a consequence, decisions that regard flexibility should not be left to software developers alone. By taking a Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) approach, starting from DEMO ontological enterprise models and explicit (enterprise) implementation design decisions, the aim of this research is to bridge the gap from enterprise agility to software adaptability, in such a way that software development is no longer a limiting factor in achieving enterprise agility. Low-code technology is a growing market trend that builds on MDSD concepts and claims to offer a high degree of software adaptability. Therefore, as a first step to show the potential benefits to use DEMO ontological enterprise models as a base for MDSD, this research shows the design of a mapping from DEMO models to Mendix for the (automated) creation of a low-code application that also intrinsically accommodates run-time implementation design decisions.},

This can take place, for instance, in the case of an inappropriate choice of a BP modeling formalism. Many frameworks have therefore been proposed in order to guide the selection of the most suitable formalism. Nevertheless, these research efforts still scattered throughout a wide range of publications, unlinked and often with a narrow scope. Hence, there is a need for both a combination of these research labors into a single reference source and an approach to support such combination. This paper is the first contribution toward responding to this need. It proposes a methodological roadmap as a basis for developing a selection support system. The results presented in the current paper stand for a first step toward a reference framework for helping researchers and practitioners in choosing the most appropriate BP modeling formalism given a set of contextual variables. The proposed methodological roadmap is specified using a modeling formalism (MAP) which considers the “decision” as a first-class citizen.},

LE is a controlled natural language (CNL), which is designed both to be computer-executable and to be readable by English speakers without special training. The basic form of LE is syntactic sugar for logic programs, in which all sentences have the same standard form, either as rules of the form conclusion if conditions or as unconditional sentences of the form conclusion. However, LE extends normal logic programming by introducing features that are present in other computer languages and other logics. These features include typed variables signalled by common nouns, and existentially quantified variables in the conclusions of sentences signalled by indefinite articles. Although LE translates naturally into a logic programming language such as Prolog or ASP, it can also serve as a neutral standard, which can be compiled into other lower-level computer languages.},

	abstract = {Complex system development and maintenance face the challenge of dealing with different types of models due to language affordances, preferences, sizes, and so forth that involve interaction between users with different levels of proficiency. Current conceptual data modelling tools do not fully support these modes of working. It requires that the interaction between multiple models in multiple languages is clearly specified to ensure they keep their intended semantics, which is lacking in extant tools. The key objective is to devise a mechanism to support semantic interoperability in hybrid tools for multi-modal modelling in a plurality of paradigms, all within one system. We propose FaCIL, a framework for such hybrid modelling tools. We design and realise the framework FaCIL, which maps UML, ER and ORM2 into a common metamodel with rules that provide the central point for management among the models and that links to the formalisation and logic-based automated reasoning. FaCIL supports the ability to represent models in different formats while preserving their semantics, and several editing workflows are supported within the framework. It has a clear separation of concerns for typical conceptual modelling activities in an interoperable and extensible way. FaCIL structures and facilitates the interaction between visual and textual conceptual models, their formal specifications, and abstractions as well as tracking and propagating updates across all the representations. FaCIL is compared against the requirements, implemented in crowd 2.0, and assessed with a use case. The proof-of-concept implementation in the web-based modelling tool crowd 2.0 demonstrates its viability. The framework also meets the requirements and fully supports the use case.},

	abstract = {Agile is often associated with a lack of architectural thinking causing technical debt but has the advantage of user centricity and a strong focus on value. Model-driven software engineering (MDSE) strongly performs for building a quality architecture and code, but lacks focus on user requirements and tends to consider development as a monolithic whole. The combination of Agile and MDSE has been explored, but a convincing integrated method has not been proposed yet. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the specific combination of MERODE—as an example of a proven MDSE method—with Scrum, a reference agile method offering a concrete (sprint-based) life cycle management on the basis of user stories. The method resulting of this integration is called Agile MERODE; it is driven by user stories, themselves associated with behavior-driven development scenarios. It allows for domain-driven design and permits fast development from domain models by means of code generation. An illustrative example further clarifies the practical application of Agile MERODE, while a case study shows the planning game application in the case’s context. While the approach, in its entirety, allows reducing technical debt by building the architecture in a logical, consistent and complete manner, introducing MDSE involves a trade-off with pure value-driven development. Agile MERODE contributes to the state of the art by showing how to increase user centricity in MDSE, how to align model-driven engineering with the Scrum cycle, and how to reduce the technical debt of agile developments yet remaining value-focused.},

	abstract = {Conceptual models are intended to capture knowledge about the world. Hence, the design of conceptual models could be informed by theories about what entities exist in the world and how they are constituted. Further, a common assumption within the field of conceptual modeling is that conceptual models and information systems describe entities in the real world, outside the systems. An alternative view is provided by an ontological commitment that recognizes that the institutional world is constructed through language use and the creation of institutional facts. Such an ontological commitment implies that there is an institutional reality, which, to a great extent, is constructed using information infrastructures. Accordingly, conceptual models have not only a descriptive role but also a prescriptive one, meaning that modelers set up a framework of rules that restrict and enable people to construct institutional reality using information infrastructures. Understanding the prescriptive role of conceptual models may revive the area of conceptual modeling in the information systems research community. Reviving conceptual modeling through institutional modeling is motivated by the effect that implemented conceptual models have on information infrastructures and institutions. The purpose of this article is to propose an institutional ontology that can support the design of information infrastructures. The ontology is theoretically informed by institutional theory and a communicative perspective on information systems design, as well as being empirically based on several case studies. It is illustrated using a case study in the welfare sector. A number of guidelines for modeling institutional reality are also proposed.},

Choosing a cloud provider and service option (e.g., a database-as-a-service or a manually configured set of virtual machines) typically requires the estimation of the cost and migration duration for each considered option. Many organisations also require this information for budgeting and planning purposes. Existing cloud migration research focuses on the software components, and therefore does not address this need. We introduce a two-stage approach which accurately estimates the migration cost, migration duration and cloud running costs of relational databases. The first stage of our approach obtains workload and structure models of the database to be migrated from database logs and the database schema. The second stage performs a discrete-event simulation using these models to obtain the cost and duration estimates. We implemented software tools that automate both stages of our approach. An extensive evaluation compares the estimates from our approach against results from real-world cloud database migrations.},

	abstract = {The present study was part of a larger surveillance effort to identify the determinants of African honey bee health, and, particularly, to detect honey bee pathogens across Kenya, where 160 colonies were examined from 32 apiaries (five colonies/apiary). From each colony, 20 individual foragers, nurse bees, worker pupae, and drone pupae were sampled separately. These were organized as 30 foragers, 32 nurse bees, 28 worker pupae, and 10 drone pupae pools. Nucleic acid was extracted from the pooled homogenates and tested using a panel of 18 different (RT-)PCR methods targeted at detecting Paenibacillus larvae, Melissococcus plutonius, Ascophaera apis, Aspergillus spp., Nosema ceranae, N. apis, Deformed wing virus (DWV), Varroa destructor virus 1 (VDV 1), Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), Sacbrood virus (SBV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), and Kashmir bee virus. All amplified bands were sequenced and compared to the GenBank database. VDV 1 was the most abundant virus at 50\% prevalence in the 100 bee pools. It was closely followed by DWV at 44\%. The others were BQCV (36\%), SBV (14\%), IAPV (9\%), ABPV (8\%), and N. ceranae (5\%). The pathogens co-existed within apiaries. VDV 1 was present in 66\% of the apiaries, DWV in 69\%, BQCV in 69\%, SBV in 28\%, IAPV in 22\%, ABPV in 19\%, and N. ceranae in 13\%. The study concludes that these pathogens should be incorporated in honey bee disease surveillance activities in the region.},

	abstract = {India has one of the largest railway networks in the world, it is proposed that some of its lands could be utilized for tree plantation and carbon sequestration activities. In this study, we make an effort to estimate the potential land available for carrying out plantation activities on Indian railways land and further estimate the carbon mitigation potential from these activities. Two land options are considered for plantation activities, (a) Plantations along Railway Tracks (along the route length) and (b) Plantations around railway sidings. The available land along the railway tracks is derived by systematically eliminating the land parcels that are non-suitable using high-resolution satellite data. We eliminated lands that are either already forested or already having tree cover. Uncultivable wastelands (open barren lands) and railway lines passing through water bodies, bridges, railway station platforms, crossings, etc. are also eliminated. Our analysis suggests that a maximum of total potential area of about 56.5 thousand hectares may be available for plantation and other mitigation actions along railway tracks and railway sidings. We used the CO2 fix model for simulating plot level carbon dynamics, the model is simulated for 35 years from 2015 to 2050. The model has been tested and validated for different forest ecosystems across the world in multiple studies. Plot-level simulations are carried out for each Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) as AEZs represent homogenous climatic, ecological, and edaphic units. Plot level mitigation estimates in each of the carbon pools are extrapolated for the available land area and considered for plantation activities in each of the Agro-ecological Zones. This study finds that Indian railways provide a modest mitigation potential (of about 5–25 MtCO2 over 2015–2050, depending on combinations of the area considered for plantations and growth rates), compared to other options available in the Indian landuse change sector such as forest restoration and reclamation of wastelands via tree plantations.},

Traditional methods mainly focus on low-level analysis of surveillance video data and lack user interaction. Therefore, there is a strong demand of easy-to-use interaction for efficiently analyzing surveillance video information. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale approach merged on the data flow, objects, and frames to achieve visualization of surveillance video data. Combined with the advantage of sketch interaction, the design of multi-scale structure makes the analysis of surveillance content natural and fluent with annotation of video contents. Extensive user studies demonstrate the effectiveness for facilitating users’ interactive visual analysis in surveillance video exploration and significantly reduce playback time to confirm available information.},

Recently Web-based applications of the Semantic Web project played an important role. A number of past knowledge engineering experiences were placed in a new technological context. However, integration of classic rule-based systems with the Semantic Web technologies is quite challenging. Furthermore, we discuss some common uses of rules in the area of software engineering. A recent emerging computing paradigm of context-aware systems is also an important area for rules. Finally, we take a look at rules as a general programming paradigm.},

The most interesting case is the collaborative one where there is a clear mutual engagement of participants in a coordinated effort to solve problems together.

The overall safety of a vehicle can be seen from multiple aspects, such as passive safety, active safety, and functional safety. Functional safety addresses the hazards that are caused by malfunctioning of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems. There are many factors that impact functional safety such as the organization and management, the development process, the design of the systems, the system type and technologies used in it, the quality control methods, etc. The ISO 26262 standard provides the state of the art of functional safety in automotive industry.

Enterprise architecture provides stakeholder-oriented frameworks and methods supporting producing and consuming information products that satisfy collaborating stakeholders’ concerns. However, while stakeholder analysis suggests identifying relationships between stakeholder and their practices, this has not yet been incorporated in the enterprise architecture standard ISO 42010 and frameworks such as TOGAF. The current lack of support for relationships between stakeholder practices limits analysis and right-sizing of the use of information products in a multi-stakeholder environment, where stakeholders collaborate while having different, possibly divergent, interests, work to be done, goals, and information needs over time. This paper presents a situation viewpoint that can be used to extend stakeholder analysis in enterprise architecture framework with relationships to improve the understanding of why and how information products are used in constellations of stakeholders where each stakeholder plays a role.

However, the logical modeling (logical aspect) from the intentional aspect represented by eLEL is largely lacking in conceptual information to be exploited in the purely IT aspect of Praxeme. In this paper, we propose the use of the ReLEL lexicon to specify the intentional aspect of Praxeme in order to automate the process covering the business and IT aspects of the enterprise. ReLEL is an enterprise terminology database and has precise information concerning the conceptual representation of an information system. For this purpose, we have proposed rules to automate the articulation that covers the intentional, semantic, logical and software aspects of Praxeme.

	abstract = {The first aspect of requirements engineering namely, determining the decisions of interest is considered here. The three kinds of decisions, that is, decisions for formulating policies, policy enforcement rules and operational decisions are identified. Policies are represented in first order logic and an expression in logic is considered as a hierarchy. Each node in the hierarchy gives us a policy formulation decision. Policy enforcement rules are derived from policies by considering the different ways in which policies can be violated. Each violation yields rules from which an appropriate selection of the rules to be adopted must be made. This yields decisions for formulating the rules. Finally, operational decisions are obtained from policy enforcement rules. Computer based support for formulating decisions is outlined.},

We start by discussing the AI roots of rules and elaborate on different kinds and types of rules. We then focus on a more careful treatment of rules in symbolic AI. There, they constitute an approach which allows for the representation of knowledge and basic automated reasoning. Originally, one of the most important areas for rule applications were expert systems. We will discuss them, along with a much broader perspective. What makes rule-based representation and reasoning particularly interesting is the opportunity for the formalization of rule languages. Therefore, selected logic-based formalizations are considered. We present in more detail a family of so-called attributive logics. Based on these concepts we introduce important requirements for a formalized description of rule based-systems.},

While we give our examples using the family of languages known as description logic (DL), conceptual modeling may be done using other knowledge representation languages. We work primarily in description logic because: (1) the level of expressivity meets most of the requirements of the applications we build; (2) DL language design prioritizes support for efficient, sound, and complete reasoning; and (3) there are a number of open source and commercial tools available. This choice does not imply that DL alone is sufficiently expressive for every application, especially in cases where we need to execute rules or evaluate formulae. Most of the time, however, we can build ontologies in DL and augment them with rules or other logic for application purposes. Because many available tools support convenient checks for logical consistency of ontologies, we can eliminate many of the errors that would otherwise be inconvenient to find in large software and rule-based applications (Nitsche et al., 2014).},

	abstract = {The model-driven development is most promising methodology for cyber-social systems (CSS), cyber-enterprise systems (CES), cyber-physical systems (CPS), and some other types of complex systems. Causality is an important concept in modeling; it helps to reveal the properties of the domain hidden from the outside observer. Great results of CPS engineering based on the perceived causality of specific domain—physical system. The subject domain of the CES as well as of CSS is a complex system type named “an enterprise”. The aim of the article is to enhance a model-based development (MDD) process with a causal modeling approach. The causal modeling aims to reveal the causality inherent to the specific domain type and to represent this deep knowledge on CIM layer. To do this, you need to add a new layer of MDA—a layer of domain knowledge discovery. Traditional MDA/MDD process use the external observation-based domain modeling on CIM layer. Such models assigned to empirical as they based on the notations that do not include causal dependencies, inherent to the domain type. From the causal modeling viewpoint, an enterprise considered to be a self-managed system driven by the internal needs. The specific need creates a particular causal dependence of activities—a management functional dependence (MFD). Concept of the MFD denotes some meaningful collaboration of activities—the causal interactions required by the definite internal need. The first step is conceptualization of the perceived domain causality on CIM layer. A top level conceptual causal model of MFD is defined as a management transaction (MT). The next step is the detailed MT modeling when an elementary control cycle (EMC) is created for each MT. EMC reveals the internal structure of MT and goal-driven interactions between MT internal elements: a workflow of data/knowledge transformations. The results of this study help to better understand that the content of the CIM layer should be aligned with the domain causality as close as reasonable. The main contribution is the extended MDA scheme with a new layer of the domain knowledge discovery and the causal knowledge discovery (CKD) technique tailored for enterprise domain. Technique uses twofold decomposition of management transaction: a control view-based and self-managing view based. The outcome of technique is hierarchy of management transactions and their internal components: lower level management functions and processes, goals, knowledge and information flows. Causal knowledge discovery technique is illustrated using the study programme renewal domain.},

From computational perspective, IT-enabled services rely on Web services and relationships between software components (i.e., collaboration, substitution, inheritance, etc.). These relationships lead to rethink Web services selection and discovery based on dependencies between them, and redesign Web service compositions to cope with changes in service processes. Within the context of service reference and requirement models and collaborative processes driven by business artifacts, this chapter introduces the digital service ecosystem and its underlying computational infrastructure. Moreover, ad hoc and rule-driven composition algorithms are also discussed. The composition rules express multiple constraints on the control flow of Web service execution (e.g., structure rules), impose dependencies among Web services, and set constraints on their nonfunctional properties. This chapter presents a new approach to Web service discovery that considers implicit social-like relationships between Web services and end-to-end Web service selection framework, considering quantitative or qualitative nonfunctional properties.},

Moreover, the semi-automated prototyping of the structure of the knowledge bases is possible. The schemas of XTT decision tables can be obtained, along with default inference links between tables. We introduce the main intuitions behind the ARD+ method and its formalization. Then an algorithm for prototyping the structure of the XTT rule base is given.
