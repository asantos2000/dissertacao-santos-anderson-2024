AB  - Previous literature has suggested that temporality is an important component of enterprise risk management (ERM). Studies have focused attention on single instruments or processes, such as budgets, forecasts, risk maps, or risk silos, and the ways these shape the time horizons of organizational actors. Yet, we still know relatively little about the role of time in shaping the “dynamics of (dis)integrated risk management” (Arena, Arnaboldi & Palermo, 2017). To explore the notion of temporality and its role in shaping the contours of ERM, we investigated a Brazilian sugar-ethanol conglomerate (Group) and its use of ERM during a period of change and accelerated expansion between 2008 and 2015. To better understand how different temporalities were embedded and performed in ERM arrangements across Group, we draw upon the works of social theorist Theodore Schatzki (2002, 2010) as well as literature in accounting. In examining ERM through a temporal lens, this paper makes two contributions. First, we complement previous studies on the everyday practices underlying enterprise risk management by focusing on how temporality shapes the trajectories and limits of ERM practice. Second, we contribute to research interested in exploring how temporality shapes the situated functionality of accounting (Ahrens & Chapman, 2007) by highlighting how multiple representations of the past, present, and future are simultaneously implicated in risk management practice across organizational sites. Overall, our findings suggest that without a clear understanding of how different and sometimes conflicting time-horizons shape particular practices of risk management, it is rather difficult to assess whether ERM can become sensitive to longer-term risks.

AB  - We conduct a large scope field investigation of 19 major incidents in 19 large European insurance and banking institutions, based on 116 post-event interviews with managers and top executives over a two-year period. We demonstrate the power of the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) method for detecting human biases documented by the behavioral finance, the organizational behavior and occupational psychology literatures. These biases constitute key operational risk factors these organizations. We find that organizational biases (such as a breach of psychological contract) take center stage as root causes of incidents in these organizations. We also find that banks are more exposed to emotional biases (fear and greed) and insurance companies more subjected to cognitive conservatism as root cause biases. This research has direct implications regarding how banks and insurance companies may cope with regulations that put a greater emphasis on measuring and controlling operational risk and specifically misconduct risk.

AB  - This paper presents an agent-based model of cybersecurity as a participatory public good. Ineffective cybersecurity measures pose serious threats and risks to the development and stability of information societies in the world. Various doctrines and thesis explore how this domain should be treated by the public and private stakeholders. One of these doctrines is cybersecurity as a public good. In this paper, we highlight divergent views about the type of cybersecurity as an economic good. Then, the paper proposes an agent-based simulation model of a repeated public goods game among a set of defenders that are in an uncertain environment with incomplete and imperfect information. In the model, defenders have a probability to choose contribution or being a free-rider, depending on their own preferences and facing with revealed preferences of other defenders. This model implements a utility maximization that applies to each individual, modeling the existence of free-riders, punishments, and interdependency of decisions under a polycentric governance structure. The results of this simulation model show that, over time, defenders update their preferences in reaction to the behavior of other defenders and the experience of cyber-attacks. They indicate a high level of contribution to the provision of cybersecurity as a public good and the effectiveness of decentralized punishment on increasing the contributions. The consistency of the pattern of our results across different empirical studies lends us some reassurance that our model behavior is in quantitative agreement with empirical macro-structures. Furthermore, implementation of a polycentric structure challenges all the relevant agents to take action, and provides more robust environment.

AB  - The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer a universal framework for addressing pressing global economic, environmental, and social challenges. Central to the SDG agenda is the vital role of business innovation in fostering positive change and promoting the triple bottom line of sustainability: people, planet, and prosperity. Many years have passed following the SDGs’ inception, yet the engagement of business innovation scholarship with the SDGs remains sparse. Moreover, a comprehensive review examining the convergence of business, innovation, and sustainability through the lens of the SDGs is notably absent, constraining insights into present advancements and prospective trajectories. In this regard, this study adopts the SDGs as a lens to investigate the contribution of business innovation to sustainable development challenges and its impact on the SDG agenda. To do so, this study conducts a systematic literature review, incorporating a bibliometric analysis of articles published in top-tier business journals, to offer an integrated overview of current trends in business, innovation, and sustainability research through the lens of the SDGs. In addition, this study performs a content analysis to consolidate and synthesize relevant research in this space, resulting in a multi-dimensional framework that illustrates the intricate, dynamic interplay between the drivers, dimensions, and impacts of business innovation on sustainability and their relationship with the SDGs. In doing so, this study accentuates extant gaps, delineates profound implications, and proposes meaningful directions to advance the understanding of the intersection between business, innovation, and sustainability in the context of the SDGs.

We compared the effectiveness, efficiency, completeness, and ethical compliance of GPT-generated Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) policies, with those from established security vendors and government cybersecurity agencies, using game theory, cost-benefit analysis, coverage ratio, and multi-objective optimization. Our findings demonstrated that GPT-generated policies could outperform human-generated policies in certain contexts, particularly when provided with tailored input prompts. To address the limitations of our study, we conducted our analysis with thorough human moderation, tailored input prompts, and the inclusion of legal and ethical experts. Based on these results, we made recommendations for corporates considering the incorporation of GPT in their GRC policy making.

AB  - Data breaches have been causing havoc for many years and continue to rise, demanding a more comprehensive framework to assess their severity. This study proposes a cybersecurity risk quantification and classification framework, addressing a significant research gap in breach severity evaluation. The study has two main objectives: to present a structured model for precise breach severity assessment, and to apply this model to real-world data breaches for practical insights. To achieve these objectives, we utilize a content analysis methodology to gauge severity of data breaches. This is followed by a robust likelihood impact matrix analysis, serving as a decision analytics tool, to effectively quantify potential risks. The integration of these approaches yields a more comprehensive and nuanced evaluation for assessing data breach severity. The proposed framework is then applied to data breaches gathered from Standard & Poor’s (S&P 500) organizations, revealing hacking and loss/theft of portable media as the breach types with the highest impact and probability. Drawing from these insights, our study suggests effective strategies to mitigate data breach risks for organizations. The implications of our research findings offer valuable contributions to both academic research and practical cybersecurity risk management.

AB  - Accounting, often referred to as the language of business, is concerned with recording, sorting, summarizing, reporting, and interpreting data related to business transactions. Accounting information assists executives, auditors, investors, regulators, and others in decision-making. Virtually every type of concern requires accounting records. Bookkeepers (also referred to as accounting technicians or accounting clerks) perform the day-to-day recording of financial data such as sales, income, purchases, and accounts payable. Accountants design accounting systems, prepare and interpret reports based on the financial transactions recorded by bookkeepers, and prepare and file reports with government agencies. Because of the huge problem of fraud by some executives who prepare financial statements, Congress passed the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, among other laws. Thus, senior executives in organizations understand the importance of governance, risk management, and compliance. At the same time, fraud investigators are skilled at methods of conducting fraud investigations involving huge amounts of digital financial data.

How well prepared are financial services multinationals for regulatory compliance? Cloud based Fintech companies are disrupting traditional banking models, signaling that highly regulated firms must adopt Cloud technologies. The paper focuses on understanding specific risks in relation to Cloud adoption, and the regulations and penalties for non-compliance being put in place. From the findings, we theorize a framework for deciding when to engage strategically with, or avoid Cloud technologies. This helps executives balance the need to innovate with the need to manage compliance risk. We then detail emerging effective practices for managing Cloud based innovation on a sustainable basis. While we focus on global financial services, the analysis applies to all regulated industries, wherever Cloud based innovations impact materially on business-critical services.

All security and corporate managers now need to be concerned with compliance and governance of risks, security, and the information usage in their systems. These processes have evolved over the past 10 years into an area known as GRC. GRC is an acronym for Governance, Risk, and Compliance and includes corporate considerations of risks, methods and techniques for the gathering, and evaluations of risks, then reporting those identified risks to regulators, outside entities, and corporate Boards of Directors. The standard statutory and regulatory order of precedence for US Laws and Regulations is not always easy to follow and understand. There are many levels of legal requirements throughout the security community. This chapter discusses those legal requirements in detail.

AB  - This case study adopts a positivist perspective to examine how Petroleo Brasileiro S.A (“Petrobras”), a high-profile company in its native Brazil with multiple listings including in Brazil and the US, responded to a major corruption scandal arising in 2014. We consider Petrobras's response both in terms of its visible activities – i.e. in relation to anti-corruption and compliance (“ACC”) disclosures in its annual report (AR) and sustainability report (SR), as well as actioned remedial policies that constitute the crisis plan – and how the company went about interacting with stakeholders during and after the immediate crisis period. We conducted a content analysis of ACC disclosures and assessed Petrobras's remedial activities in the eight-year period 2010–2017 as disclosed in its ARs, SRs and press releases. We find firstly that, consistent with legitimacy theory, Petrobras responded by voluntarily and substantially increasing its relevant disclosures so as to regain legitimacy, a finding which mirrors those found elsewhere following corruption and environmental crises. Secondly, the unique corporate governance situation at Petrobras combined with the fact that leadership was allegedly implicated in the scandal, led the post-crisis management team to undertake a series of remedial actions that prioritised the need to take and maintain executive control and independence from the government, whilst at the same time carefully managing the relationship with this influential stakeholder: - actions which argue strongly in favour of stakeholder-agency theory and multiple agency theory interpretations of the nature of stakeholder interactions that transpired during the crisis period of disequilibrium, and which precluded the type of stakeholder dialogue seen in some previous environmental crisis situations. Finally, we show that Petrobras's crisis management response actions align well with models of trust repair and legitimacy management, and suggest the company considered it had successfully regained legitimacy by 2017.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) adoption is rapidly growing at a compound annual growth rate of 33.2%, projecting to reach a 730-billion-dollar market by 2028. However, with the increasing adoption of AI systems, new foreseeable social and human safety risks are becoming a significant concern. Public trust in AI technologies is key to realizing AI's potential for society and the global economy. To ensure public safety whilst sustaining the growth of AI technologies, regulators worldwide are proposing to control the rising risk of AI automated decision making through legislation. The proposed legislation introduces a new dimension of ethical behaviors as part of compliance assurance obligations to address the human risk factors from irresponsible use of AI systems. To date, literature has extensive coverage of ethical AI relating to accountability, responsibility, and transparency. However, the area of auditability of AI systems, especially regarding ethical aspects of AI systems, is in its early stages. It has become increasingly clear that the current literature needs to expand to the practical implementation of ethics-based audit, automation, and hyperscale to enable continuous compliance of AI systems. We propose approaching the automation of audits for AI systems by decomposing the AI system into individual components and applying a risk-based approach to develop controls and metrics to continuously measure an AI system's compliance posture against organizational policy.

AB  - Innovations for a low-carbon economy and carbon neutrality are the focal points of technology development in the energy sector. This paper aims to investigate the progress of technology and advancements in the energy sector and the implications for Indonesia via two routes, viz., renewable energy and energy efficiency. The methodology employed in this research is divided into two parts. Firstly, an extensive literature review was conducted to identify prevalent research trends within the energy sector. Second, a case study method was performed to gain a comprehensive understanding of energy transformation within the electricity and steel sectors. The study presents two key findings. First, the energy sector has experienced significant technological disruption, providing the opportunity for Indonesia to transition towards a low-carbon development. This includes smart grids, energy-intensive industries, electric vehicles, and storage (pumped storage and battery). Second, lessons from the steel industry show that the technology selection is sensitive to parent company, and this is not easily captured in literature studies. Indonesian has gained many benefits from the global technological disruption, but this is not sufficient without developing changes in support system and consumer behavior.

AB  - This study analyzed the Coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis from the angle of cyber-crime,highlighting the wide spectrum of cyberattacks that occurred around the world. The modus operandi of cyberattack campaigns was revealed by analyzing and considering cyberattacks in the context of major world events. Following what appeared to be substantial gaps between the initial breakout of the virus and the first COVID-19-related cyber-attack, the investigation indicates how attacks became significantly more frequent over time, to the point where three or four different cyber-attacks were reported on certain days. This study contributes in the direction of fifteen types of cyber-attacks which were identified as the most common pattern and its ensuing devastating events during the global COVID-19 crisis. The paper is unique because it covered the main types of cyber-attacks that most organizations are currently facing and how to address them. An intense look into the recent advances that cybercriminals leverage, the dynamism, calculated measures to tackle it, and never-explored perspectives are some of the integral parts which make this review different from other present reviewed papers on the COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitative methodology was used to provide a robust response to the objective used for the study. Using a multi-criteria decision-making problem-solving technique, many facets of cybersecurity that have been affected during the pandemic were then quantitatively ranked in ascending order of severity. The data was generated between March 2020 and December 2021, from a global survey through online contact and responses, especially from different organizations and business executives. The result show differences in cyber-attack techniques; as hacking attacks was the most frequent with a record of 330 out of 895 attacks, accounting for 37%. Next was Spam emails attack with 13%; emails with 13%; followed by malicious domains with 9%. Mobile apps followed with 8%, Phishing was 7%, Malware 7%, Browsing apps with 6%, DDoS has 6%, Website apps with 6%, and MSMM with 6%. BEC frequency was 4%, Ransomware with 2%, Botnet scored 2% and APT recorded 1%. The study recommends that it will continue to be necessary for governments and organizations to be resilient and innovative in cybersecurity decisions to overcome the current and future effects of the pandemic or similar crisis, which could be long-lasting. Hence, this study's findings will guide the creation, development, and implementation of more secure systems to safeguard people from cyber-attacks.

AB  - Information technology Governance, Risk management and Compliance (IT-GRC) are critical in the contemporary business environment since most of the business processes rely on information technology. However, studies indicate that off-the-shelf IT-GRC products are unsuitable for measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of IT-GRC controls. This article proposes a novel approach of measuring effectiveness and efficiency of IT-GRC controls by using the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology and arriving at the Figure of Merit (FoM) to find the optimal value of effectiveness and efficiency. The proposed method quantifies the input values by calculating the relative influence and cause of the controls. The efficiency and effectiveness are analysed based on the key metrics such as performance, the strength of security controls, ease of use and cost. The proposed method has been applied to various scenarios with varying controls for evaluation and then the optimal value (Figure of Merit) is found by an iterative method. This method can be extended to any type of IT security control standards and frameworks such as ISO 27001, COBIT 5, ITIL and PCI-DSS.

AB  - The areas of Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) and innovation are under-explored in research generally, and specifically in sustainability-oriented research. In this paper we propose a practice-based concept of Compliance-Innovation and set out its significance for sustainability. Development of the concept is based on a literature review and exploratory qualitative research with eighteen practitioners. The concept acknowledges the central role of knowledge integration across business domains as the basis of modern competitive advantage. The absence of such integration in the GRC and innovation domains, revealed in practice, opens opportunities. The governing force for such integration is presented here as sustainability, when applied as a strategic orientation for business. We outline how the integration of GRC and innovation domains drive commercial exploitation for environmental sustainability and business sustainability. Building on the concept of Absorptive Capacity we identify both external and internal sources of knowledge as determinants of organization's selected sustainability goals, which are relevant across the phases of organizations' innovation activities throughout its Innovation Value Chain. We argue that a quality-based orientation is necessary to derive value from the networks employed in applying the concept in practice.

AB  - In an in-depth field study, we investigate cyber security governance configurations vis-à-vis the five lines of accountability (5 LoA) – that is, the Three Lines Model extended by the accountability of executive management and the board of directors (IIA, 2020). The aim is to explore the configurations adopted by organizations in governing cybersecurity, and why it would matter for cyber security whether the five lines of accountability are adopted. We define the type of the 5 LoA adoption by: (i) the segregation of the lines that spans from blended to segregated and (ii) the level of engagement of those in line roles that ranges from low to high. In this way, we identify four types of adoption of the 5 LoA: ‘no adoption, ‘ostensible’, ‘implicit’, and ‘explicit’ adoption. We theorize how the type of adoption of the 5 LoA is affected by the interplay of institutional forces and organizations’ need for efficiency and effectiveness, and develop a pathway model for organizations’ adoption of the 5 LoA. We find that organizations that adopt the 5 LoA with clear segregation between these lines (‘ostensible’ and ‘explicit’ adoption) are those subject to prudential regulation (coercive forces), whereas efficiency motives and mimetic forces drive organizations to seek fluidity and flexibility by ‘blending’ the segregated lines (‘implicit’ adoption) to ensure fast reactions to changing environment. Regardless of the segregation between lines and whether they are blended or not, we found that all organizations see scope to improve the level of engagement in the 5 LoA to improve the effectiveness of cyber security governance.

AB  - The focus of this research revolves around applying the dynamic capabilities (DC) considering technological, organizational, and environmental dimensions (TOE framework) to explore the digital transformation (DT) and innovation. The current literature has shown a limited focus on integrating DC with the TOE framework, inspiring this research to address this gap. This research adopts a quantitative approach employing partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), leveraging a survey with 325 respondents from 48 banks in Indonesia. The study identifies the necessary organizational capabilities for DT and innovation, encompassing technological capabilities representing technology, strategic and organizational capabilities representing the organizational dimension, as well as ecosystem and governance-risk-compliance (GRC) capabilities representing the environmental dimension. The findings unveil that technology and ecosystem capabilities have a positive and significant impact on DT and innovation. Organizational capabilities positively influence innovation but exhibit a negative impact on DT. Strategic capabilities positively affect DT and negatively impact innovation, while GRC capability enhances its role in DT, contributing to improved company performance. This research adds to the theoretical understanding of DC within the TOE framework and offers managerial insights to assist the banking sector in effectively managing capabilities for successful DT and innovation.
