  abstract={The hospitality business has completely changed in recent times. This is due to the emergence of smart technology, which has resulted in a better experience for customers while increasing the operational efficiency of the industry. One of the advanced technologies currently being used by these service companies is Virtual Reality (VR). Using cognitive evaluation theory, the aim of this research is to examine what motivates customers to adopt Smartphone-Based Virtual Reality Systems (SBVR) at Ciputra Hotel Jakarta. This study focuses on customers who have never used or experienced the SBVR application before. This study adopted a quantitative approach and used a convenient sample involving 165 participants. The findings reveal that consumer attitudes toward the SBVR application at Ciputra Hotel Jakarta prove positive when the application offers a pleasurable experience (perceived enjoyment) and effective data or functional benefits (perceived usefulness). Moreover, it was revealed that attitude has a beneficial impact on intention. It is hypothesized that consumers who have a positive view of SBVR applications are more likely to intend to use them. Based on principles from the psychology and intelligent technology literature, this study enhances our understanding of how customers react to the implementation of SBVR in Hospitality companies.},

  title={MatGap: A Systematic Approach to Perform Match and Gap Analysis among SBVR-Based Domain Specific Business Rules}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={551-560},
  abstract={In the modern age, the need for automation has led to Business Organizations representing their functionality as structured Business Rules. SBVR has come up as an universally popular format for representation of Business Rules. The presence of different Business Organizations working in a particular real life domain results in generation of different rules for each of the organization. Due to the varying business practices, like mergers & acquisitions, upgrades, incorporation of a new application, etc., it becomes necessary to compare a set of Business Rules of a particular organization with the rules of a reference model, to get a measure of similarity among the business functionality of the two. Presently, this comparison is carried out manually by business experts or by executing the rules of one organization with the data of another and checking if they are compliant. Both the approaches are extremely tedious and expensive as modern organizations have huge rule sets and data sets.We present MatGap, a tool which performs a systematic Match and Gap Analysis between two sets of SBVR-based Business Rules applicable to a specific domain, using Global Vectors(GloVe) model and SMT-LIBv2. The analysis report gives a measure of Match among the rules and entities, thus providing the best alignment and aids to identify the representational Gaps(if any) among the rules and entities. The tool also checks whether the embedded logic in the reference Business Rule set is covered by the other Rule set, thus highlighting the business functionality gap that is present in the latter.},

  title={The Semantic of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules: An Automatic Generation From Textual Statements}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={56506-56522},
  abstract={In the early phases of the software development process, specifications are mostly written in a natural language rather than formal models, which is not supported by the Model Driven Architecture (MDA). For this reason, the Semantic of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) is proposed by the Object Management Group to represent the textual specifications in a language comprehensible by both of humans and machines, to facilitate its integration in the MDA lifecycle. However, businesspeople are usually not familiar with SBVR standard. In this paper we present an approach to automatically transform textual business rules to an SBVR model, to facilitate its integration in nowadays information technology infrastructures. Our approach is distinguished from existing works in that it uses an in-depth Natural Language Processing to extract a more comprehensible SBVR model that includes the semantic formulation of each business rule statement, coupled with a Terminological Dictionary of extracted concepts, to which we have added further specifications such as definitions and synonyms. The evaluation of our approach shows that for three sets of business rules statements taken from different domains, we could generate the correct meaning with an average of F1-score exceeding 87%.},

  abstract={Business rules are used to define or limit certain aspects of business. While they should be understandable for different interested parties, including business analysts, end-users, programmers, or testers, it is also highly recommendable that computers efficiently process them. Business rules can be expressed using different languages (styles), potentially influencing their quality. The main aim of this research is to determine which of the business rule specification notations used at early stages of software development (CIM level) is the best for different groups of recipients. The paper presents the results of the experiment designed to compare the usability of two business rule specification languages: SBVR SP (Polish version of SBVR SE), and RuleSpeak®. These languages have very similar expressiveness and scope of application. Both introduce some restrictions on word order (grammar) and expressions used. Their usability was assessed from three perspectives: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. The study was conducted on three groups of participants representing various user groups. It occurred that SBVR SP is more useful than RuleSpeak.},

  abstract={Service choreography describes the interaction across different participating services capturing the ordering constraints of global message exchanges. Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) model, an Object-Oriented Management (OMG) standard is proposed to specify services interaction (service choreographies), The specification focuses on a deontic rule expressing both prohibition and obligation which can be progressively helpful in working with coordinating service interactions. Then Alloy Analyzer, a relational constraint solver, is used to transform a developed service choreographies, an SBVR model into an Alloy model. This transformation allows to generate and to verify, the choreography for the developed SBVR model and the realisability of the generated choreography, automnatically.},

  abstract={An enterprise system operates business by providing various services that are guided by set of certain business rules (BR) and constraints. These BR are usually written using plain Natural Language in operating procedures, terms and conditions, and other documents or in source code of legacy enterprise systems. For implementing the BR in a software system, expressing them as UML use-case specifications, or preparing for Merger & Acquisition (M&A) activity, analysts manually interpret the documents or try to identify constraints from the source code, leading to potential discrepancies and ambiguities. These issues in the software system can be resolved only after testing, which is a very tedious and expensive activity. To minimize such errors and efforts, we propose BuRRiTo framework consisting of automatic extraction of BR by mining documents and source code, ability to clean them of various anomalies like inconsistency, redundancies, conflicts, etc. and able to analyze the functional gaps present and performing semantic querying and searching.},

  abstract={The service choreography approach has been proposed for describing the global ordering constraints on the observable message exchanges between participant services in service oriented architectures. Recent work advocates the use of structured natural language, in the form of Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR), for specifying and validating choreographies. This paper addresses the verification of choreographies - whether the local behaviours of the individual participants conform to the global protocol prescribed by the choreography. We describe how declarative specifications of service choreographies can be verified using a trace-based model, namely an adaptation of Shields' vector languages. We also use the so-called blackboard rules, which draw upon the Bach coordination language, as a middleware that adds reactiveness to this declarative setting. Vector languages are to trace languages what matrices are to linear transformations; they afford a more concrete representation which has advantages when it comes to computation or manipulation.},

  abstract={Benefiting from the intuitiveness and naturalness of sketch interaction, sketch-based video retrieval (SBVR) has received considerable attention in the video retrieval research area. However, most existing SBVR research still lacks the capability of accurate video retrieval with fine-grained scene content. To address this problem, in this paper we investigate a new task, which focuses on retrieving the target video by utilizing a fine-grained storyboard sketch depicting the scene layout and major foreground instances’ visual characteristics (e.g., appearance, size, pose, etc.) of video; we call such a task “fine-grained scene-level SBVR”. The most challenging issue in this task is how to perform scene-level cross-modal alignment between sketch and video. Our solution consists of two parts. First, we construct a scene-level sketch-video dataset called SketchVideo, in which sketch-video pairs are provided and each pair contains a clip-level storyboard sketch and several keyframe sketches (corresponding to video frames). Second, we propose a novel deep learning architecture called Sketch Query Graph Convolutional Network (SQ-GCN). In SQ-GCN, we first adaptively sample the video frames to improve video encoding efficiency, and then construct appearance and category graphs to jointly model visual and semantic alignment between sketch and video. Experiments show that our fine-grained scene-level SBVR framework with SQ-GCN architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art fine-grained retrieval methods. The SketchVideo dataset and SQ-GCN code are available in the project webpage https://iscas-mmsketch.github.io/FG-SL-SBVR/.},

  abstract={Existing sketch-analysis work studies sketches depicting static objects or scenes. In this work, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval problem of fine-grained instance-level sketch-based video retrieval (FG-SBVR), where a sketch sequence is used as a query to retrieve a specific target video instance. Compared with sketch-based still image retrieval, and coarse-grained category-level video retrieval, this is more challenging as both visual appearance and motion need to be simultaneously matched at a fine-grained level. We contribute the first FG-SBVR dataset with rich annotations. We then introduce a novel multi-stream multi-modality deep network to perform FG-SBVR under both strong and weakly supervised settings. The key component of the network is a relation module, designed to prevent model overfitting given scarce training data. We show that this model significantly outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art models designed for video analysis.},

  title={A Double Sensing Scheme With Selective Bitline Voltage Regulation for Ultralow-Voltage Timing Speculative SRAM}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={53},
  number={8},
  pages={2415-2426},
  abstract={A double sensing with selective bitline voltage regulation (DS-SBVR) scheme is proposed to improve the throughput of ultralow-voltage static random access memory (SRAM). It senses the bitline voltage swing twice and compares two samples for confirmation. The bitline voltage is dynamically regulated by charge sharing between two sensing steps. Different from other timing speculative SRAMs, its error flag is generated much earlier; therefore, it achieves a higher reading throughput. Meanwhile, a digitized timing scheme is proposed to generate configurable timing pulses for the DS-SBVR. Compared with other timing techniques, it has a better ability to process, voltage, temperature (PVT) tracking and variance suppression. For fair comparison of performance/power/area, three different columnbased timing speculative designs are implemented in the same technology. A 28-nm test chip including 40 SRAM macros (128 × 32) is fabricated to demonstrate the scheme. Compared with the conventional design, measurements show that DS-SBVR achieves 1.45× throughput gain at 0.6-V SS corner. The figure of merit (FOM) is introduced for power, performance, and area (PPA) gain comparison. Compared with the conventional design, the FOMs of PPA gain are 1.54 and 2.33 in 128-row and 512-row memories, respectively. Compared with other timing speculative SRAMs, it achieves 1.83×-2.24× improvement.},
