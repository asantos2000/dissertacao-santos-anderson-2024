  abstract={In this paper, we present a controlled natural language (CNL) framework for automatic processing and generation of assertions from hardware design specification. Current CNL systems have limitations in mapping differently worded sentences with the same meaning to the same logic structures. We aim to mitigate this limitation by developing a dependency grammar based CNL where the constructed parse tree does not follow strict surface-structure dependencies and instead extract additional relationship based on semantic information that is embedded in the grammar. In addition, current translation schemes for creating executable assertions from hardware design specifications do not provide feedback on wrongly or ambiguously written input sentences. Our natural language understanding algorithm is guided by the dependencies in the parse tree and has the capability to offer useful feedback for sentences that are not fully understood. We reported results on natural language assertions extracted from UART, Memory and AMBA AXI protocol specification documents. We successfully tested syntactic variations of these specifications as well.},

  abstract={Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) is key to the vision of the intelligent Web. Unfortunately, wide deployment of KRR is hindered by the difficulty in specifying the requisite knowledge, which requires skills that most domain experts lack. A way around this problem could be to acquire knowledge automatically from documents. The difficulty is that, KRR requires high-precision knowledge and is sensitive even to small amounts of errors. Although most automatic information extraction systems developed for general text understandings have achieved remarkable results, their accuracy is still woefully inadequate for logical reasoning. A promising alternative is to ask the domain experts to author knowledge in Controlled Natural Language (CNL). Nonetheless, the quality of knowledge construction even through CNL is still grossly inadequate, the main obstacle being the multiplicity of ways the same information can be described even in a controlled language. Our previous work addressed the problem of high accuracy knowledge authoring for KRR from CNL documents by introducing the Knowledge Authoring Logic Machine (KALM). This paper develops the query aspect of KALM with the aim of getting high precision answers to CNL questions against previously authored knowledge and is tolerant to linguistic variations in the queries. To make queries more expressive and easier to formulate, we propose a hybrid CNL, i.e., a CNL with elements borrowed from formal query languages. We show that KALM achieves superior accuracy in semantic parsing of such queries.},

  abstract={Knowledge base creation and population are an essential formal backbone for a variety of intelligent applications, decision support and expert systems and intelligent search. While the abundance of unstructured text helps in easing the knowledge acquisition gap, the ambiguous nature of language tends to impact accuracy when engaging in more complex semantic analysis. Controlled Natural Languages (CNLs) are subsets of natural language that are restricted grammatically in order to reduce or eliminate ambiguity for the purposes of machine processability, or unambiguous human communication within a domain or industry context, such as Simplified English. This type of human-oriented CNL is under-researched despite having found favor within industry over many years. We describe a novel dataset which aligns a representative sample of Simplified English Wikipedia sentences with a well known machine-oriented CNL. This linguistic resource is both human-readable and semantically machine interpretable and can benefit a variety of NLP and knowledge based applications.},

  abstract={In the last years, cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular along with their underlying distributed ledger technology, referred to as a Blockchain (BC). Nowadays, a wide variety of BC implementations are available. However, the selection of a suitable implementation for a particular application or use case is complex because it requires a technical understanding of the underlying BC implementation aspects. Therefore, this paper proposes a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) to extends existing BC selection solutions to abstract underlying implementation details. The approach allows the specification abstract high-level policies, referred to as intents, in an English-based language. The approach is inspired by previous approaches from the network management field. Moreover, a state machine-based refinement technique is proposed to refine these intents into low-level BC selection policies. The results of the performance evaluation of the prototype implementation show that the refinement process presents a minimal overhead. In addition, the perceived intuitiveness of the CNL by users was assessed in a survey. The results of the survey suggest that technical and non-technical individuals benefit from an intentbased approach equally.},

  abstract={Currently, requirements for control software written in natural language are often formulated ambiguously and incompletely. Controlled natural languages (CNLs) can solve this problem, at the same time maintaining flexibility for writing and conveying requirements in an intuitive and common way. The creation of domain-specific controlled natural languages nowadays is under active development. In this paper, we suggest CNL which is based on event-driven semantics. This language is intended for describing the temporal properties of cyber-physical systems. We develop our CNL using a number of natural language patterns build for classes of requirements expressed in Event-Driven Temporal Logic formalism (EDTL). Due to formal semantics of EDTL, the suggested CNL is also unambiguous and can be translated into logic formulas. As a result, the proposed CNL provides an auxiliary tool to improve communication quality between different participants in the industrial system development process: customers, requirements engineers, developers, and others. Therefore, the solution helps to reduce the number of errors in the formulation of requirements at earlier stages of development.},

  pages={6:1-6:12},
  abstract={Smart contracts, which are widely recognized as key components of blockchain technology, enable automatic execution of agreements. Since each smart contract is a computer program that autonomously runs on a blockchain platform, their development requires much effort and care compared with the development of more common programs. In this paper, we propose a technique to automatically generate a smart contract from a human-understandable contract document that is created using a document template and a controlled natural language (CNL). The automation is based on a mapping from the document template and the CNL to a formal model that can define the terms and conditions in a contract including temporal constraints and procedures. The formal model is then translated into an executable smart contract. We implemented a toolchain that generates smart contracts of Hyperledger Fabric from template-based contract documents via a formal model. We then evaluated the feasibility of our approach through case studies of two types of real-world contracts in different domains.},

  abstract={Biomedical image segmentation has a lot of significance in disease detection and diagnosis. Many researchers proposed many deep learning architectures such as U-Net, SegNet, DualChexNet, DualANet for biomedical image segmentation. Recently, a novel lightweight architecture namely CNL-UNet is proposed for multimodal biomedical image segmentation. The CNL-UNet used the CNL module, res-path, and transfer learning for effective biomedical image segmentation. In this paper, we made an in-depth analysis of the CNL-UNet to prove its robustness on multimodal biomedical image segmentation. We experimented in detail with the various components of the CNL-UNet. We made eight combinations of the CNL-UNet by removing or adding these components and experimented with these eight combinations on the ultrasound and MRI datasets. The results show that the CNL module helps the model to reduce the false outputs and gain high precision, recall, and F1 score. The res-path has a remarkable contribution to provide precise segmentation and increasing the performance of the model. And also, transfer learning plays an important role in faster convergence and also in increasing the performance of the network. In essence, this experiment increases the confidence of the CNL-UNet regarding its remarkable performance on multimodal biomedical image segmentation.},

  abstract={On social networks, the storage, usage, and sharing of users data is usually regulated by privacy policies: natural language terms, in which specific actions are authorised, obliged, or denied, under some contextual conditions. Although guaranteeing degrees of readability and clarity, policies in natural language are not machine readable, thus preventing automatic controls on how the data are actually going to be used and processed by the entities that operate on them. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach for automatic translation of privacy statements, from natural language to a controlled natural one, to facilitate machine-readable processing. We provide a prototype implementation of the software-based translation tool, showing its effectiveness on a set of Facebook data policies.},

  abstract={Automated formalization of legal texts in order to remove ambiguities, conflicts and incompleteness has been a challenge for Requirements Engineering (RE) research for decades. This work seeks to make an incremental step towards this objective for legal contracts by making use of contract templates. Our proposed approach starts with a natural language contract template, together with a manually formalized specification of that template. A contract writer can make customizations to the template, which trigger the automatic formalization of the corresponding customized contract. Our target specification language is Symboleo, which is created specifically for contract verification and monitoring. Starting with a manually formalized template reduces the complexity associated with a fully automated formalization. Typical contract templates use simple fill-in-the-blank parameters, which serve as customizations to formalize in our framing of the problem. Our approach pushes the boundaries of these templates by allowing the contract writer to enter complex natural language customizations, such as prepositional phrases and conditional statements. This work explores what types of natural language patterns can be used in that context by analyzing relevant linguistics and real legal contracts. It also introduces a tool, SymboleoNLP, that suggests the feasibility of the formalization process.},

  abstract={The hospitality business has completely changed in recent times. This is due to the emergence of smart technology, which has resulted in a better experience for customers while increasing the operational efficiency of the industry. One of the advanced technologies currently being used by these service companies is Virtual Reality (VR). Using cognitive evaluation theory, the aim of this research is to examine what motivates customers to adopt Smartphone-Based Virtual Reality Systems (SBVR) at Ciputra Hotel Jakarta. This study focuses on customers who have never used or experienced the SBVR application before. This study adopted a quantitative approach and used a convenient sample involving 165 participants. The findings reveal that consumer attitudes toward the SBVR application at Ciputra Hotel Jakarta prove positive when the application offers a pleasurable experience (perceived enjoyment) and effective data or functional benefits (perceived usefulness). Moreover, it was revealed that attitude has a beneficial impact on intention. It is hypothesized that consumers who have a positive view of SBVR applications are more likely to intend to use them. Based on principles from the psychology and intelligent technology literature, this study enhances our understanding of how customers react to the implementation of SBVR in Hospitality companies.},

  pages={551-560},
  abstract={In the modern age, the need for automation has led to Business Organizations representing their functionality as structured Business Rules. SBVR has come up as an universally popular format for representation of Business Rules. The presence of different Business Organizations working in a particular real life domain results in generation of different rules for each of the organization. Due to the varying business practices, like mergers & acquisitions, upgrades, incorporation of a new application, etc., it becomes necessary to compare a set of Business Rules of a particular organization with the rules of a reference model, to get a measure of similarity among the business functionality of the two. Presently, this comparison is carried out manually by business experts or by executing the rules of one organization with the data of another and checking if they are compliant. Both the approaches are extremely tedious and expensive as modern organizations have huge rule sets and data sets.We present MatGap, a tool which performs a systematic Match and Gap Analysis between two sets of SBVR-based Business Rules applicable to a specific domain, using Global Vectors(GloVe) model and SMT-LIBv2. The analysis report gives a measure of Match among the rules and entities, thus providing the best alignment and aids to identify the representational Gaps(if any) among the rules and entities. The tool also checks whether the embedded logic in the reference Business Rule set is covered by the other Rule set, thus highlighting the business functionality gap that is present in the latter.},

  abstract={In this paper we compare human understanding of information represented in a natural language (NL) to a type of artificial language, called a Controlled Natural Language (CNL). Potential applications for CNLs include decision support and conversational agents, but currently there is limited empirical research on the understandability of CNLs for untrained humans. We investigate a particular type of CNL, called Controlled English (CE), which was designed to be a simplified, artificial subset of natural language that is both human readable and unambiguous for fast and accurate machine processing. We quantify and compare human understanding of NL and CE using accuracy and speed for language statements. The statements described entities (people and objects) and relations (actions) among entities with the ground-truth represented using visual diagrams. Participants responded whether the statements matched the diagram (yes/no). In Experiment I, we found accuracy for NL and CE was comparable, although the speed for understanding CE was slower. To further examine the role of speed, we induced time pressure in Experiment II. We found both the accuracy and speed for CE was lower than NL. These results indicate that if people have sufficient time, understanding for CE can be equivalent to NL. However, with limited time the accuracy and speed for understanding NL is better than CE. Our findings indicate that both accuracy and speed of CNLs should be evaluated. Furthermore, under time pressure there can be meaningful differences in accuracy and speed between different ways of representing information. Understanding for methods of representing machine information has potential implications for situation understanding and management with human-machine interaction and collaboration.},

To address this issue, we present a tool, named Paska, that takes as input any NL requirements, automatically detects quality problems as smells in the requirements, and offers recommendations to improve their quality. Our approach relies on natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a state-of-the-art controlled natural language (CNL) for requirements (Rimay), to detect smells and suggest recommendations using patterns defined in Rimay to improve requirement quality. We evaluated Paska through an industrial case study in the financial domain involving 13 systems and 2725 annotated requirements. The results show that our tool is accurate in detecting smells (89% precision and recall) and suggesting appropriate Rimay pattern recommendations (96% precision and 94% recall).},

  abstract={Automatic creation of formal models from natural language specifications can help reduce design time and manual errors. However, the accuracy of the translation may not be high due to the ambiguous, incomplete, and inconsistent nature of natural language. Specifications written in a controlled natural language (CNL) can overcome the problems associated with natural language translation and deliver similar benefits in automation. However, a user has to learn to write in a CNL. We propose a suggestions framework that provides automatic feedback to assist users in writing specifications in CNL. Our feedback generates different ways of writing CNL acceptable sentences when the input sentence is not understood. We developed a ranking scheme to ensure the semantics of generated suggestions are closer to the input specification’s intent. We evaluated the framework on 132 erroneous specifications taken from AMBA and memory controller architectures documents. Our system generated suggestions for all the specs. On manual inspection, we found that 87% of these suggestions were semantically closer to the intent of the input specification.},

The device simulation considers drift-diffusion transport, SS charge neutrality level (CNL), MIGS through Fermi level pinning parameter ( ${S}$ ), doping and temperature-dependent mobility model, incomplete ionization of dopants, and impact ionization models. The simulation validation is carried out for Al/Au Schottky metals at room temperature and at higher temperatures. A good comparison between the simulation and experiment is obtained around turn-on voltage ( ${V}_{T{0}}~\sim ~1.0$  V for Al and ~2.0 V for Au Schottky contacts) and for anode voltage ( ${V}_{A}{)} > {V}_{T{0}}$ . Through simulations, we estimated the type of SSs and their quantity, and the position of CNL ( ${E}_{\text {CNL}}$ ) within the diamond bandgap. The effect of  ${E}_{\text {CNL}}$  position and pinning parameter on the forward and reverse characteristics is also simulated. The impact of  ${E}_{\text {CNL}}$  and SS on reverse leakage current is also analyzed using a nonlocal barrier tunneling model. At higher temperatures, a good match between simulation and experiment of forward characteristics is achieved.},

It is revealed that 3-stacked NSHFET shows 9.09% lesser VT variation compared to 3-stacked nanowire FET (NWFET) due to combined ITV sources such as charge neutrality level (CNL), single charged traps (SCTs), and random interface traps (RITs). The 3-stacked NSHFET and NWFET reduces the ITV induced VT variation by 31.3% and 28.8% respectively compared to the single stacked transistors. The NSHFETs of higher effective channel width shows better immunity to ITV. It is found that both Si NSHFET and NWFET transistors effectively suppresses the combined ITV sources induced VT, ION, and drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) variations when the CNL is positioned between midgap and conduction band edge of the semiconductor bandgap.},

The popular form to write requirements specifications is with natural languages that, however, exhibit characteristics that often introduce quality problems, such as inconsistency, incompleteness, and vagueness, which shall be mitigated or avoided to some extent. This paper is part of a series of papers that have discussed linguistic patterns and linguistic styles to produce technical documentation more systematically and consistently. Specifically, this paper proposes a cohesive set of patterns and styles to better write use cases and scenarios. It also presents 38 practical guidelines and supports the discussion with concrete pedagogical examples represented with different styles, namely: visual use cases diagram (UML), a rigorous requirements specification language (RSL), and two informal controlled natural languages, one with a compact (CNL-A) and another with a more complete and verbose writing style (CNL-B). We conducted a pilot evaluation session with 24 subjects who provided encouraging feedback, with positive scores in all the analyzed dimensions. Based on this feedback, we may conclude that the adoption of these patterns, styles, and guidelines would help to produce better requirements specifications, written more systematically and consistently.},

  abstract={In the early phases of the software development process, specifications are mostly written in a natural language rather than formal models, which is not supported by the Model Driven Architecture (MDA). For this reason, the Semantic of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) is proposed by the Object Management Group to represent the textual specifications in a language comprehensible by both of humans and machines, to facilitate its integration in the MDA lifecycle. However, businesspeople are usually not familiar with SBVR standard. In this paper we present an approach to automatically transform textual business rules to an SBVR model, to facilitate its integration in nowadays information technology infrastructures. Our approach is distinguished from existing works in that it uses an in-depth Natural Language Processing to extract a more comprehensible SBVR model that includes the semantic formulation of each business rule statement, coupled with a Terminological Dictionary of extracted concepts, to which we have added further specifications such as definitions and synonyms. The evaluation of our approach shows that for three sets of business rules statements taken from different domains, we could generate the correct meaning with an average of F1-score exceeding 87%.},

  abstract={Business rules are used to define or limit certain aspects of business. While they should be understandable for different interested parties, including business analysts, end-users, programmers, or testers, it is also highly recommendable that computers efficiently process them. Business rules can be expressed using different languages (styles), potentially influencing their quality. The main aim of this research is to determine which of the business rule specification notations used at early stages of software development (CIM level) is the best for different groups of recipients. The paper presents the results of the experiment designed to compare the usability of two business rule specification languages: SBVR SP (Polish version of SBVR SE), and RuleSpeak®. These languages have very similar expressiveness and scope of application. Both introduce some restrictions on word order (grammar) and expressions used. Their usability was assessed from three perspectives: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. The study was conducted on three groups of participants representing various user groups. It occurred that SBVR SP is more useful than RuleSpeak.},

  abstract={Requirements specification and verification play an important role in the certification of safety-critical software (SCS). These activities are costly and error-prone because SCS exhibit a high number of requirements and most SCS manufacturers are still using natural language to specify these requirements. On one hand, natural language can introduce ambiguity and inconsistency. On the other hand, formal languages add an overhead to the requirements specification because of their complexity. Controlled Natural Languages (CNLs) fill these gaps by offering a middle-ground solution, although not yet well adopted by the industry. In this paper, we introduce an approach that combines CNLs and model-driven engineering (MDE) for requirements specification. The approach was proposed to support an industrial partner in the certification process of a SCS. Our approach uses templates and relies on two types of models: models that specify the templates, and a model of the domain of the system at hand. Using models of the templates enables to automate some requirements analysis tasks. Using a domain model allows the auto-completion and verification of requirements specified using the templates. We implemented the approach and validated it using three case studies and more than a thousand requirements. We observed that our approach and underlying templates are applicable across domains and that the templates yield requirements with better quality in terms of necessity, ambiguity, completeness, singularity, and verifiability.},

  abstract={An enterprise system operates business by providing various services that are guided by set of certain business rules (BR) and constraints. These BR are usually written using plain Natural Language in operating procedures, terms and conditions, and other documents or in source code of legacy enterprise systems. For implementing the BR in a software system, expressing them as UML use-case specifications, or preparing for Merger & Acquisition (M&A) activity, analysts manually interpret the documents or try to identify constraints from the source code, leading to potential discrepancies and ambiguities. These issues in the software system can be resolved only after testing, which is a very tedious and expensive activity. To minimize such errors and efforts, we propose BuRRiTo framework consisting of automatic extraction of BR by mining documents and source code, ability to clean them of various anomalies like inconsistency, redundancies, conflicts, etc. and able to analyze the functional gaps present and performing semantic querying and searching.},

  abstract={The service choreography approach has been proposed for describing the global ordering constraints on the observable message exchanges between participant services in service oriented architectures. Recent work advocates the use of structured natural language, in the form of Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR), for specifying and validating choreographies. This paper addresses the verification of choreographies - whether the local behaviours of the individual participants conform to the global protocol prescribed by the choreography. We describe how declarative specifications of service choreographies can be verified using a trace-based model, namely an adaptation of Shields' vector languages. We also use the so-called blackboard rules, which draw upon the Bach coordination language, as a middleware that adds reactiveness to this declarative setting. Vector languages are to trace languages what matrices are to linear transformations; they afford a more concrete representation which has advantages when it comes to computation or manipulation.},

  abstract={Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) has become an emerging paradigm to solve complex urban sensing problems by utilizing the ubiquitous sensing capacities of the crowd. One critical issue in MCS is to efficiently allocate tasks to users. We focus on addressing the task allocation problem in a distributed manner, where each user individually and freely makes his decision to undertake tasks. Existing distributed schemes simply consider users behave completely selfishly, which leads to inefficient solutions and damages the overall benefit of all users. Different from existing schemes, in this paper we integrate the social relationship into users' decision making and build a socially aware utility model for each user, which consists of both user's own utility and the weighted sum of his social neighbors' utilities. Based on this, we formulate a novel Socially Aware Task Selection (SATS) game for users in MCS. We theoretically prove the existence of pure Nash equilibrium in the SATS game with the help of a potential game framework. We further propose a distributed user selection algorithm to actually achieve the pure Nash equilibrium. Extensive simulations based on both real and synthetic social relationship graph datasets demonstrate that our approach can achieve more efficient solutions which improve users' overall benefit compared with existing schemes.},

ROO (Rabbit to OWL Ontologies Authoring) tool is used in this work to eliminate the ambiguous requirement in natural language by using Controlled Natural Language (CNL). The ontology result from this tool, then, is translated into OWL before this OWL model is mapped into the XML file of data dictionary. Test cases are generated from this XML file by using Combination of Equivalence and Classification Tree Method (CCTM). This testing technique enables the redundant test cases to be eliminated and the coverage of testing to be increased. The contribution of this work has been explored by using the real case study. The result shows how the requirement ontology enhances the testing technique as we expected.},

  abstract={Digital games are becoming more and more a part of our daily lives. After realizing this, several educators have been motivated to use games as teaching and learning tools. In this sense, it is possible to involve teachers and students in the production of their own games, thus contributing both to the development of computational thinking and to acquiring knowledge related to the different disciplines involved in this process. Despite the benefits, the production of games is a complex task that requires knowledge of a specific domain and presents a significant learning curve for students and teachers. The choice of using effective strategies such as Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) practices supported by a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) to promote the production of games in the educational context is decisive and can favor the adoption of game-based learning. This work proposes a strategy for the specification of game design for digital games by students and teachers in the classroom, that can promote the development of computational thinking, as well as reading and writing skills.},

  abstract={Benefiting from the intuitiveness and naturalness of sketch interaction, sketch-based video retrieval (SBVR) has received considerable attention in the video retrieval research area. However, most existing SBVR research still lacks the capability of accurate video retrieval with fine-grained scene content. To address this problem, in this paper we investigate a new task, which focuses on retrieving the target video by utilizing a fine-grained storyboard sketch depicting the scene layout and major foreground instances’ visual characteristics (e.g., appearance, size, pose, etc.) of video; we call such a task “fine-grained scene-level SBVR”. The most challenging issue in this task is how to perform scene-level cross-modal alignment between sketch and video. Our solution consists of two parts. First, we construct a scene-level sketch-video dataset called SketchVideo, in which sketch-video pairs are provided and each pair contains a clip-level storyboard sketch and several keyframe sketches (corresponding to video frames). Second, we propose a novel deep learning architecture called Sketch Query Graph Convolutional Network (SQ-GCN). In SQ-GCN, we first adaptively sample the video frames to improve video encoding efficiency, and then construct appearance and category graphs to jointly model visual and semantic alignment between sketch and video. Experiments show that our fine-grained scene-level SBVR framework with SQ-GCN architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art fine-grained retrieval methods. The SketchVideo dataset and SQ-GCN code are available in the project webpage https://iscas-mmsketch.github.io/FG-SL-SBVR/.},

  abstract={Building the system right is the objective of quality assurance methods. Though testing is the most prominent and widely-adopted means, it cannot prove the absence of software's defects. Therefore, static measures such as formal proofs can complement dynamic methods. However, these techniques require the formal statement of requirements, which is still a challenge in industry development. This paper suggests a way of formalizing requirements in controlled natural language in a way that applies directly to C program code. By mapping natural language terms to conditional breakpoints, requirements can be translated to formal language expressed in observer automata. The creation of a mapping between natural language terms and code is supported by natural language processing methods. Finally, the observer automata are model checked against the code. In our approach we demonstrate the described steps using a set of realistically shaped requirements, which are common in the avionics domain. We implemented a simple tool hiding the abstract and mathematical details, which performs the proofs automatically. The paper is presented as an approach towards the seamless verification of code against requirements typically found in the avionics domain.},

Compared with sketch-based still image retrieval, and coarse-grained category-level video retrieval, this is more challenging as both visual appearance and motion need to be simultaneously matched at a fine-grained level. We contribute the first FG-SBVR dataset with rich annotations. We then introduce a novel multi-stream multi-modality deep network to perform FG-SBVR under both strong and weakly supervised settings. The key component of the network is a relation module, designed to prevent model overfitting given scarce training data. We show that this model significantly outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art models designed for video analysis.},

  number={8},
  pages={2415-2426},
  abstract={A double sensing with selective bitline voltage regulation (DS-SBVR) scheme is proposed to improve the throughput of ultralow-voltage static random access memory (SRAM). It senses the bitline voltage swing twice and compares two samples for confirmation. The bitline voltage is dynamically regulated by charge sharing between two sensing steps. Different from other timing speculative SRAMs, its error flag is generated much earlier; therefore, it achieves a higher reading throughput. Meanwhile, a digitized timing scheme is proposed to generate configurable timing pulses for the DS-SBVR. Compared with other timing techniques, it has a better ability to process, voltage, temperature (PVT) tracking and variance suppression. For fair comparison of performance/power/area, three different columnbased timing speculative designs are implemented in the same technology. A 28-nm test chip including 40 SRAM macros (128 × 32) is fabricated to demonstrate the scheme. Compared with the conventional design, measurements show that DS-SBVR achieves 1.45× throughput gain at 0.6-V SS corner. The figure of merit (FOM) is introduced for power, performance, and area (PPA) gain comparison. Compared with the conventional design, the FOMs of PPA gain are 1.54 and 2.33 in 128-row and 512-row memories, respectively. Compared with other timing speculative SRAMs, it achieves 1.83×-2.24× improvement.},

  abstract={Extracting and fusing part features have become the key of fined-grained image recognition. Recently, Non-local (NL) module has shown excellent improvement in image recognition. However, it lacks the mechanism to model the interactions between multi-scale part features, which is vital for fine-grained recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-layer non-local (CNL) module to associate multi-scale receptive fields by two operations. First, CNL computes correlations between features of a query layer and all response layers. Second, all response features are weighted according to the correlations and are added to the query features. Due to the interactions of cross-layer features, our model builds spatial dependencies among multi-level layers and learns more discriminative features. In addition, we can reduce the aggregation cost if we set low-dimensional deep layer as query layer. Experiments are conducted to show our model achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets of fine-grained classification.

  abstract={This study analyses consumer last-mile delivery service choice behaviour by developing a cross-nested logit model (CNL); we then compare the analytical results with three nested logit models (NL). The model parameters are estimated using the data from a questionnaire collected from consumers residing in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shandong. The direct elasticities and cross-elasticities are then calculated to assess the change in probability of each alternative caused by utility variables. Parameter estimation results demonstrate that the CNL model outperforms the three NL models. Consumers are usually reluctant to change the way they are served when utility variables are altered. Moreover, elasticity analysis results suggest that service factors have the strongest effect on choice probability, followed by socioeconomic factors and delivery activity factors. Thus, enterprises should first strive to promote the service experience of consumers in corresponding delivery services, then account for the effect of socioeconomic factors, and finally consider changing delivery service fees if they want to induce consumers to select a specified delivery service.},

  abstract={The paper presents a neuromorphic platform that can emulate a small-scale cortical network with diverse types of neurons and synapses found in cortical circuits. The platform provides configurable neurons, which behave similarly to the electrophysiological behaviours of different classes of pyramidal and interneurons, and configurable long- and short- term dynamic synapses that can provide inhibition, excitation, weight depressing and facilitating and spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) dynamics. The prototype of the platform presented in this paper uses a single Cortical Neural Layer (CNL) integrated circuit (IC), which facilitates a network of 120 neurons and 7560 synapses. The number of CNL ICs used in the proposed architecture can be increased to enable larger neural network emulation. The network connectivity is configured using an off-chip Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device. The parameters of the neural elements of the network can be configured using a computer-controlled bias voltages generator. To prove the concept in hardware, Winner-Take-All and Synfire chain networks have been implemented on the platform, and the results are presented.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a sensing-assisted neighbor discovery algorithm that utilizes the sensing capability of radar to improve the efficiency of neighbor discovery for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). To store and manage the sensing information of radar, we design the sensing neighbor list (SNL) by analogy with the communication neighbor list (CNL). For vehicle mobility, we build a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) state evolution model and use extended Kalman filtering (EKF) to predict, track, and update the kinematic parameters of nodes, which are stored in the SNL. Specifically, the conversion relationship between CNL and SNL is implemented by the designed SNL based neighbor discovery (SBND) algorithm. Numerical simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is significant in terms of vehicle tracking and communication overhead reduction.},

  abstract={Architecture conformance checking is an important means for quality control to assess that the system implementation adheres to its defined software architecture. Ideally, this process is automated to support continuous quality control. Many different approaches exist for automated conformance checking. However, these approaches are often limited in terms of supported concepts for describing and analyzing software architectures. We have developed an ontology-based approach that seeks to overcome the limited expressiveness of existing approaches. As a frontend of the formalism, we provide a Controlled Natural Language. In this paper, we present an industrial validation of the approach. For this, we collected architectural rules from three industrial projects. In total, we discovered 56 architectural rules in the projects. We successfully formalized 80% of those architectural rules. Additionally, we discussed the formalization with the corresponding software architect of each project. We found that the original intention of each architectural rule is properly reflected in the formalization. The results of the study show that projects could greatly benefit from applying an ontology-based approach, since it helps to precisely define and preserve concepts throughout the development process.},

  abstract={This work reports for the first time ultrathin atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) InZnO as a novel back-end-of line (BEOL) channel material for monolithic 3D integration. By tuning the ratio of In to Zn with ALD cycles, InZnO transistors with 3.5 nm channel thickness can achieve excellent subthreshold swings (SS) as low as 65 mV/dec, high on-off current ratio up to $10 ^{11}$, and sizeable on-current density (ION) up to 1.33 A/mm for In-rich channels at 100 nm channel length with drain voltage (VDS) of 1 V. A surprising high degree of stability under large positive gate bias stress (statistically measured threshold voltage shift $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{T}$ of -16 mV after 1500 s stress with gate voltage bias (VBias) of 3.5 V) is observed in the In:Zn $=1$:1 case. ALD process resolves the long-time concern on the stability of sputtered InZnO films as the channels without Ga doping. A charge-neutrality-level (CNL) alignment and trap generation model is proposed to explain this unique phenomenon of negligible VT shift under positive gate bias stress (PBS). Finally, ground-signal-ground (GSG) structures are also fabricated to investigate the RF performance of these BEOL-compatible transistors with GHz operation frequencies.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},

  pages={260-264},
  abstract={Formal ontology and rule-based approaches founded on semantic technologies have been gaining traction in capturing domain knowledge in numerous fields. This typically requires several iterations between a Subject Matter Expert (SME) and a modeling expert to capture domain knowledge; resulting in a time-consuming process. Recent advances in formal Controlled Natural Languages (CNL) improve the process as the SME can more easily evaluate and verify the captured domain knowledge. Such executable domain rules are usually represented in some encoding / representation language and typically use variables. This use of variables does not correspond to how we naturally think about a domain and hence the difficulty that SMEs encounter in directly authoring domain rules. Our goal is to enable the SMEs to directly author the rules in a formal yet English-like language. For this purpose, we introduce the notion of Concept Rules (Crules) where the domain rules are captured in terms of concepts and relationships without the need to use variables. The absence of variables makes the captured rules much more English-like and natural and correspond more closely with how we communicate in our day-to-day life. Use of Crules will make it easier for an SME to directly author domain rules. The Crules captured are automatically converted to a target language to leverage existing execution platforms.},

  abstract={In this work, we demonstrate the record-low metal- to-semiconductor contact resistance Rc = 23.4Ω μm at n2D = 5.0 × 1013 cm−2 (reaching the quantum limit) in atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) In2O3 thin-film transistors (TFTs) with back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatibility. Our long-channel devices (Lch = 1 μm) exhibit excellent drain current saturation, while our short-channel devices (Lch = 50 nm) achieve high on-current performance (2.6 mA/μm. at 295 K, and 5.4 mA/μm at 10 K). The superior ohmic contact is made possible by the charge neutrality level (CNL) deeply aligned inside the conduction band of In2O3, which can also be understood as an interfacial donor-like trap-induced negative Schottky barrier. Notably, we investigate the contact resistance at various temperatures, O2 annealing conditions, and channel thicknesses, providing a comprehensive understanding of this material system. Furthermore, we demonstrate an ultra-low contact resistivity of ρc ≈ 1.3 × 10−9 Ω cm2 and current transfer length of LT ≈ 2 nm in 1 nm thin films. These findings position In2O3 as a highly promising candidate for ultra-scaled, high-performance BEOL transistors from the contact engineering point of view.},

  abstract={Proton range verification (PRV) through prompt gamma imaging (PGI) is a promising modality to assess the dose delivery in proton and heavy ion therapy. In AC-coupled cyclotrons, the periodicity of the proton bunches can be used as a tool to reject weakly time correlated background noise, thus increasing signal contrast, and to assess the Bragg peak position by means of the time-of-flight (TOF) information of the proton or heavy ion. In this work we study the prompt- gamma timing (PGT) signal from 3 crystals: a 3×3×20 mm3 TlBr, a 12×12×12 mm3 TlBr, and a 5×5×5 mm3 TlCl. PGT data was acquired at the Crocker Nuclear Laboraotry (CNL) in the UC Davis campus. A detector consisting of a plastic scintillator and a photomulitplier was used as the time-of-flight reference. A PMMA target was exposed to a proton beam of 1 nA and 67.5 MeV of energy and it was shifted in 3 mm increments. The three detectors showed consistent shifts for the PGT distributions with the 3 mm positions of the PMMA target. Material choice and crystal dimensions did not seem to affect the outcome of the results. These results show the Cherenkov light generated by prompt-gammas in heavy materials is a robust signal for PGT. Future measurements will include an improvement of the reference detector and the acquisition of more data with detectors with different geometries.},

  abstract={With the rise of artificial intelligence in education, the utilization of video understanding technology to identify teachers' teaching actions is becoming increasingly important for improving the quality of teaching and accelerating the process of educational informatization. However, the lack of a dedicated dataset for teacher action recognition has been a hindrance to the development of intelligent teaching. In this paper, we construct a dataset of teacher-teaching action recognition (TAR). The dataset collected classroom videos of 25 teachers in eight classrooms of vocational and technical schools, from which a total of 13,288 valid video samples were obtained after processing. The dataset contains 8 behavior categories, including 5 categories of normative teaching behaviors and 3 categories of misbehaviors. To ensure the authenticity and representativeness of the data, all actions were collected from actual classroom videos. We then tested mainstream methods on the newly constructed dataset and proposed a Cross-channel Non-local (CNL) module based on SlowFast to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed other existing methods.},

  abstract={This article presents the first certifiably correct algorithm for distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO), the backbone of modern collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping (CSLAM) and camera network localization (CNL) systems. Our method is based upon a sparse semidefinite relaxation that we prove provides globally optimal PGO solutions under moderate measurement noise (matching the guarantees enjoyed by the state-of-the-art centralized methods), but is amenable to distributed optimization using the low-rank Riemannian Staircase framework. To implement the Riemannian Staircase in the distributed setting, we develop Riemannian block coordinate descent (RBCD), a novel method for (locally) minimizing a function over a product of Riemannian manifolds. We also propose the first distributed solution verification and saddle escape methods to certify the global optimality of critical points recovered via RBCD, and to descend from suboptimal critical points (if necessary). All components of our approach are inherently decentralized: they require only local communication, provide privacy protection, and are easily parallelizable. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method correctly recovers globally optimal solutions under moderate noise, and outperforms alternative distributed techniques in terms of solution precision and convergence speed.},

  abstract={As transistor dimensions reach the 3-nm node, interface and surface engineering emerges as critical considerations. Challenges introduced by reduced conductivity and mobility due to surface depletion significantly impact thickness scaling and contact performance. In this work, we report the surface accumulation in atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown In $_{\text{2}}$ O $_{\text{3}}$  thin-film transistors (TFTs). The negative Schottky barrier enables an ultralow metal-to-semiconductor contact resistance of  $\textit{R}_{\textit{c}} =\text{23.4}~\Omega\, \mu \text{m}$  at electron charge density  $\textit{n}_{\text{2D}}=\text{5.0}$   $\times$   ${\text{10}}^{\text{13}}~\text{cm}^{-\text{2}}$  in a nanometer ultrathin In $_{\text{2}}$ O $_{\text{3}}$  channel. The effect of film thickness and annealing on contact resistance is investigated. Ultralow contact resistivity  $\rho _{\textit{c}}\approx \text{1.3}$   $\times$   $ \text{10}^{-\text{9}}~\Omega\, \text{cm}^{\text{2}}$  and current transfer length  $\textit{L}_{\textit{T}} \approx\text{2}~ \text{nm}$  are achieved in a 1-nm-thick film. The superior ohmic contact is made possible by the charge neutrality level (CNL) deeply aligned inside the conduction band for In $_{\text{2}}$ O $_{\text{3}}$ . Together with theoretical calculations, the Landauer quantum resistance limit of In $_{\text{2}}$ O $_{\text{3}}$  is discussed. Furthermore, the ALD-grown In $_{\text{2}}$ O $_{\text{3}}$  transistor is back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible with a low thermal budget of 400  $^{\circ}$ C (even considering the optional O $_{\text{2}}$  annealing).

  abstract={Assurance cases are used to communicate and assess confidence in critical system properties, e.g., safety and security. Historically, assurance cases have been manually created documents, validated by engineers through lengthy and error-prone processes. Recently, system assurance practitioners have begun adopting model-based approaches to improve the efficiency and quality of system assurance activities. This becomes increasingly important, for example, to ensure the safety of robotics and autonomous systems (RASs), as they are adopted into society. Such systems can be highly complex, and so it is a challenge to manage the development life-cycle and improve efficiency, including coordination of validation activities, and change impact analysis in interconnected system assurance artifacts. However, adopting model-based approaches require skills in the model management languages, which system assurance practitioners may not be acquainted with. In this article, we contribute an automated validation framework for the model-based assurance cases, which promotes the usage of a constrained natural language (CNL), that can be automatically transformed and executed against engineering models involved in assurance case development. We apply our approach to a case study based on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).},
