AB  - In modern software development, much time is devoted and much attention is paid to the activity of data modeling and the translation of data models into databases. This has motivated the proposal of different approaches and tools to support this activity, such as semiautomatic approaches that generate data models from requirements artifacts using text analysis and sets of heuristics, among other techniques. However, these approaches still suffer from important limitations, including the lack of support for requirements traceability, the poor support for detecting and solving conflicts in domain-specific requirements, and the considerable effort required for manually checking the generated models. This paper introduces DataMock, an Agile approach that enables the iterative building of data models from requirements specifications, while supporting traceability and allowing inconsistencies detection in data requirements and specifications. The paper also describes how the approach effectively allows improving traceability and reducing errors and effort to build data models in comparison with traditional, state-of-the-art, data modeling approaches.

AB  - Manual Business Process Modeling can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, resulting in low-quality models. Therefore, various approaches have been proposed in research and practice to partially or fully automate the creation of business process models. We conducted a systematic literature review (LR) on automatic generation of business process models. The LR demonstrates that there exist various approaches for automated generation of business process models, which differ in terms of the input data, generation methods, and modeling languages utilized. Despite active research into automatic model generation, there is still considerable scope for improvement. New technologies are continually being developed to support automatic model generation. Additionally, the increasing digitalization of processes and organizations generates vast amounts of data that can be harnessed for modeling.

AB  - We present how Web standards and technologies can implement traceability in business rules. This enhances transparency of business systems with facilitated integration of system components and data. Such traceability provides end-users access to source documents describing rules and facts that apply to users. This helps both users and developers ensure that how systems work aligns with documentation they derive from. Important features of Web standards include, links to document fragments, and links from not just concepts but assertions about them. In addition, a shared identifier infrastructure enables the integration of these functions of the document and Semantic Webs. We investigate how and to what degree conforming tools for existing standards can implement this communication between these layers. Analysis of how these standards and their applied components work here provides insight into what traceable business rule implementation requires in general. Our approach is to implement an illustrative scenario with standards to demonstrate their utility and provide insights into the issues involved. This scenario comes from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which related work often uses in examples of business rule implementation.

AB  - We present methods for applying controlled natural language (CNL) and Semantic Web user interfaces to make rapid prototypes of business rule-based systems. This helps system developers quickly demonstrate design choices to stakeholders. CNLs provide a balance between understandability for laypersons and unambiguous specificity for programmers. Executable CNLs generate rudimentary systems automatically and thus quickly, which suits rapid prototyping. The Semantic Web provides a wide range of free and open tools for standardized forms of data representation and logic, whose potential application includes business rules.

AB  - The paper presents the method for describing data modeling patterns. Data modeling patterns are reusable, general solutions providing the abstraction over the domain problem, which is modeled, retaining the semantic structure of the solution. The proposed method consists of three phases: conceptualization, specification and implementation. The specification phase is based on the ontological concept system Conceptual Layer of Metamodels. The method has been verified by a case study, the Generalized Network modeling pattern and its implementation in Association-Oriented Metamodel.

AB  - Decision models are increasingly being used in modeling business processes. Hence, extracting decision models automatically from texts would help decision modellers by reducing modeling time and supporting them in their analysis. In this paper, deep learning techniques are investigated to extract decision dependencies and conditional clauses directly from text. By using a large dataset of labeled and tagged sentences and NLP, deep learning techniques (BERT and BI-LSTM-CRF) are trained and tested on the identification of these items. The results show that the performance is sufficiently high to extract decision dependency and logic (semi)-automatically from text which provides a big step towards automatic decision modelling.

AB  - Business process models are a way of knowledge representation which is widely exploited in various areas of economy and industry. They illustrate workflows executed manually by people, as well as automated sequences of tasks processed by computer software. Manual creation of a workflow model is a complex activity which requires a significant workload. This is caused by the necessity to collect and transform input data from different sources. As a solution to this problem, several techniques have been elaborated to extract knowledge from different representations in order to generate a correct business process model. In this paper, an overview and classification of such techniques which include generating process models from representations such as: natural language text, various notations, other models or logs obtained from an information system is put forward.

AB  - Adaptive Case Management (ACM) empowers knowledge workers of any industry by utilizing their experience in the execution of business cases. It is designed to handle non-repetitive processes, where the course of actions has to be decided for each case individually, based on the assessment of the current situation. ACM uses domain-specific data and the analysis of rules to provide the relevant information at the right time to the business users. This supports their actions and decision making but does not dictate predefined workflows that are difficult or even impossible to define for knowledge-intensive work and prevent users from efficiently achieving their goals. Solutions for ACM implementations need to focus on business requirements to support business users rather than limit them by extending existing tools such as content management systems, BPM-based software suites, or collaboration tools with ad hoc development that all lack the ability to adapt flexibly to business level changes without requiring significant IT development efforts. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach by applying business architecture concepts for the definition of ACM applications in combination with domain-specific ontologies and business rules. Business domain analysts describe with the domain-specific ontology the complete value stream with its goals, activities and rules which use a formalized natural business language. The resulting business information model is mapped to an underlying data model and instantly enacted during case execution so that adaptations get immediately available to the business users. The behavioral business rules guide business users to guarantee case compliance which facilitates an easy and rapid adaptation of business applications. We apply this approach to a real life example from the construction industry where several parties from different trades have to collaborate in heterogeneous environments.

AB  - Collaboration is a key factor to successful businesses. To face massive competition in which SMEs compete with well established corporates, organizations tend to focus on their core businesses while delegating other tasks to their partners. Lately, Blockchain technology has yet furthered and eased the way companies collaborate in a trust-less environment. As such, interest in researching process collaborations models and techniques has been growing. However, in contrast to BPM research for intra-organizational processes, where a multitude of process models repositories exist as a support for simulation and work evaluation, the lack of such repositories in the context of inter-organizational processes has become an inconvenience. The aim of this paper is to build a repository of collaborative process models that will assist the research in this area. A top-down approach is used to automatically generate constrained and compliant choreography models, from which public and private process models are derived. Though the generation is partly random, it complies to a predefined set of compliance rules and parameters specified by the user.

AB  - In declarative process models all the activities which do not violate a constraint of the process model can be executed. Consequently, the number of viable paths is large. In turn, when considering multiple perspectives during execution, i.e., constraints on resources and data values, it may happen that the execution of activities or the change of data values may result in the non-executability of crucial activities. Execution engines for single-perspective declarative process models have been extensively discussed in research where, among others look-ahead functionality has been investigated. Execution approaches for multi-perspective declarative models that involve constraints on data and resources, however, are less mature. In this paper, we introduce a logic based look-ahead approach for the execution of multi-perspective declarative processes. We use the look-ahead for simulating a fixed number of execution steps with regard to the existing trace and the choice of the next step. The look-ahead allows for estimating all consequences and effects of certain decisions at any time of process execution. We develop an algorithm for trace generation and checking traces using the logic language Alloy. We extensively evaluate our approach by means of a practical example and give some advice for further optimizations.

AU  - da Purificação, Carlos Eugênio P.

A2  - Latifi, Shahram
AB  - Defining system business models and rules using conceptual schemas is not an easy task. The Object Management Group’s standard SBVR—Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules, define semantics for expressing business focused vocabularies and rules. It is based on a meta-model with roots on formal first-order logic. In order to create valid business vocabulary and rules, based on this standard, business analysts need tools that can facilitate modeling efforts using the standard. In this work, we contribute with a proposed tool that would allow business analyst designers to define the keywords that represent each of the Logical Formulation Concepts in the SBVR Meta-model. Therefore, this approach would enable the creation of Controlled Natural Language Libraries based on the SBVR meta-model that can be dynamically included in SBVR Modeling projects. These Language Libraries can then be used to model business rules and vocabularies in the tool. As a result, one can support multiple controlled natural languages and represent the SBVR metamodel using the tool. Examples of different controlled natural languages using the proposed SBVR editor tool are provided.

AB  - Manual extraction of business process models from technical documentation is a time-consuming task. Several approaches to generating such process models have been proposed. We present a proposal of a new method for extracting business process from natural language text through intermediate process model using the spreadsheet-based representation. Such intermediate model is transformed into a valid BPMN process model. Our method is enhanced with semantic analysis of the text, allows for quick check of the transformation result and manual correction during this process. As the obtained BPMN model is structured, it is easier to check its correctness.

AB  - The creation of domain-specific data validation rules is commonly performed by the relevant domain experts. Such experts are often not acquainted with the low-level technologies used to actually execute these rules and will hence document them in some informal form, such as in natural language. In order to execute these rules, they need to be transformed by technical experts into a relevant executable language, such as SQL. The technical experts in turn are often not familiar with the business logic these rules are depicting and will thusly have to collaborate with the business experts to gain insight into the semantics of the rules. This paper presents an approach for writing financial data validation rules in constrained natural language, that can then be automatically transformed and executed against the data they are referring to. In order to achieve this, we use the Xtext framework for creating the editor where business experts can create their rules that can then be transformed into executable constraints. We evaluate this approach in terms of its extensibility, coverage and verboseness with respect to the business rules sent to specific UK banks submitting data under one of the Bank of England’s annual reviews.

AB  - The research for solutions for compliance is mainly focused on the representation of regulative rules, i.e. the imperatives that the industry is asked to comply to. Yet, a relevant part of the legal knowledge contained in regulation cannot be expressed in terms of deontic statements, and is instead represented as constitutive rules. This concept was first introduced by philosophers of language such as J.L. Austin and J.R. Searle and further developed in legal philosophy, where constitutive statements are classified in categories according to their legal effects. The present paper presents a heuristic approach for the representation of alethic statements as part of a methodology aimed at ensuring effective translation of the regulatory text into a machine-readable language. The approach is based on a classification of constitutive statements contained in the work of legal philosophers A.G. Conte and G. Carcaterra. The methodology includes an intermediate language, accompanied by an XML persistence model, and introduces a set of “legal concept patterns” to specifically represent the different constitutive statements. The paper identifies five patterns for the corresponding constitutive statements found in financial regulations: legal definitions, commencement rules, amendments, relative necessities, and party to the law statements.

AB  - A Process-Aware Information System is a system that executes processes involving people, applications, and data on the basis of process models. At least two process modeling paradigms can be distinguished: procedural models define exactly the execution order of process steps. Declarative process models allow flexible process executions that are restricted by constraints. Execution engines for declarative process models have been extensively investigated in research with a strong focus on behavioral aspects. However, execution approaches for multi-perspective declarative models that involve constraints on data values and resource assignments are still not existing. In this paper, we present an approach for the execution of multi-perspective declarative process models in order to close this gap. The approach builds on a classification strategy for different constraint types evaluating their relevance in different execution contexts. For execution, all constraints are transformed into the execution language Alloy that is used to solve satisfiability (SAT) problems. We implemented a modeling tool including the transformation functionality and the process execution engine itself. The approach has been evaluated in terms of expressiveness and efficiency.

AB  - Extracting constraints and process models from natural language text is an ongoing challenge. While the focus of current research is merely on the extraction itself, this paper presents a three step approach to group constraints as well as to detect and display relations between constraints in order to ease their implementation. For this, the approach uses NLP techniques to extract sentences containing constraints, group them by, e.g., stakeholders or topics, and detect redundant, subsuming, and conflicting pairs of constraints. These relations are displayed using network maps. The approach is prototypically implemented and evaluated based on regulatory documents from the financial sector as well as expert interviews.

AB  - In the early phases of software development, both of business analysts and IT architects collaborate to define the business needs in a consistent and unambiguous format before exploiting them to produce a software solution to the problem have been defined. Given the divergence of the interest areas of each intervenor, the natural language remains the most adequate format to define the business needs in order to avoid misunderstanding. This informal support suffers from ambiguity leading to inconsistencies, which will affect the reliability of the final solution. Accordingly, the Object Management Group (OMG) has proposed the “Semantic Business Vocabulary and Rules” (SBVR) standard which offers the opportunity to gather business rules in a natural language format having a formal logic aspect, letting the possibility to be understood by not only the different stakeholders but also directly processed by the machine. Since the SBVR standard is born to represent business rules by combining business vocabulary, it would be wise to give a great attention to the latter. In this paper we present an approach to extract business vocabulary according to SBVR Structured English as one of possibly notation that can map to the SBVR Meta-Model, with a view to provide a relevant resource for the next software deployment steps.

AB  - An approach for matching UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagram to OCL (Object Constraints Language) constraints of that specific class model is presented in this research paper. Class diagram describe the structure of the system and responsibilities. OCL is a language that defines rules that apply on class model. For matching the OCL (Object Constraints Language) to class model we need SBVR tool because SBVR is generated from system’s constraints. If OCL invariants and SBVR vocabulary is different than there is major error exist in software. SBVR (Symantec Business Verification Rules) tool provide SBVR vocabulary and that vocabulary and OCL elements are used for matching. However, manual matching not only difficult but it is time consuming and costly. This paper provides automated approach that checks automatically system constraints (that is written in OCL) using business rules (that is written in SBVR (Symantec Business Verification Rules)). This approach can help to check efficiently SBVR rules and OCL constraints and consume less time and effort.

AB  - The use of pragmatics in applying the law is hard to deal with for a legal knowledge engineer who needs to model it in a precise KR for (semi-)automated legal reasoning systems. The negative aspects of pragmatics is due to the difficulty involved in separating their concerns. When representing a legal norm for (semi-)automated reasoning, an important step/aspect is the annotation of legal sections under consideration. Annotation in the context of this paper refers to identification, segregation and thereafter representation of the content and its associated context. In this paper we present an approach and provide a proof-of-concept implementation for automatizing the process of identifying the most relevant judgment pertaining to a legal section and further transforming them into a formal representation format. The annotated legal section and its related judgments can then be mapped into a decision model for further down the line processing.

AB  - Although the use of apps and online services comes with accompanying privacy policies, a majority of end-users ignore them due to their length, complexity and unappealing presentation.pite the potential risks. In light of the, now enforced EU-wide, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) we present an automatic technique for mapping privacy policies excerpts to relevant GDPR articles so as to support average users in understanding their usage risks and rights as a data subject. KnIGHT (Know your rIGHTs), is a tool that finds candidate sentences in a privacy policy that are potentially related to specific articles in the GDPR. The approach employs semantic text matching in order to find the most appropriate GDPR paragraph, and to the best of our knowledge is one of the first automatic attempts of its kind applied to a company’s policy. Our evaluation shows that on average between 70–90% of the tool’s automatic mappings are at least partially correct, meaning that the tool can be used to significantly guide human comprehension. Following this result, in the future we will utilize domain-specific vocabularies to perform a deeper semantic analysis and improve the results further.

AB  - Operational decisions such as loan or subsidy allocation are taken with high frequency and require a consistent decision quality which decision models can ensure. Decision models can be derived from textual descriptions describing both the decision logic and decision dependencies. Whilst decision models already help with modeling, implementing and automating decisions, the modelling step would still benefit from a (semi)-automated approach. The introduction of ChatGPT and GPT-3 offers opportunities to automatically discover decision dependencies from a given text. This paper evaluates the performance of two approaches that automatically extract decision dependencies from text, namely the best performing version of GPT-3 with a BERT-based approach. An evaluation with 36 experiments with a dataset of real-life cases and various levels of creativity allowed for GPT-3 concludes that theBERT BERT-based approach outperforms GPT-3 on the real-life dataset but that GPT-3 has promising results and requires further investigation.

AB  - The main aim of this paper is emphasis on how to incorporate changes in existing BPMN based business process models considering the correctness and consistency. However, modifications and alterations in existing BPMN models are only time consuming but also error-prone. First, we take a BPMN model as an input and create its XML file. Then, an XML parser is used to parse the xml file and extract the BPMN and UML class elements which will further be verified. Proposed approach will overcome all the inconsistencies in case of modification within existing BPMN models which can enhance the effectiveness of any business process models. Business process exist in a business organization. Bank, open bank account, cheque cash, check balance at ATM, etc. Customer requirements vary with respect of time, then we have to update and improve, refine business processes. The frequent changes in business processes may make them inconsistent with respect to other business process. Such inconsistencies create problems in business activities. It is difficult to identify such inconsistencies manually due to involvement of lot of effort and time. There should be an automated approach or an automated tool that can help in identifying the possible inconsistencies in business processes after changes.

AB  - Extracting meaningful information from regulatory documents such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is of utmost importance for almost any company. Existing approaches pose strict assumptions on the documents and output models containing inconsistencies or redundancies since relations within and across documents are neglected. To overcome these shortcomings, this work aims at deriving mixed graphs based on paragraph embedding as well as process discovery and combining these graphs using constraint relations such as “redundant” or “conflicting” detected by the ConRelMiner method. The approach is implemented and evaluated based on two real-world use cases: Austria’s energy use cases plus the contained process models as ground truth and the GDPR. Mixed graphs and their combinations constitute the next step towards an end-to-end solution for extracting process models from text, either from scratch or amending existing ones.

AB  - Modern enterprises operate in an unprecedented regulatory environment where increasing regulation and heavy penalties on non-compliance have placed regulatory compliance among the topmost concerns of enterprises worldwide. Previous research in the field of compliance has established that the manual specification/tagging of the regulations not only fails to ensure their proper coverage but also negatively affects the turnaround time both in proving and maintaining the compliance. Our contribution in this paper is a case study using a subset of European Union Regulation in the financial markets, namely, Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR) and that we validated it in the context of our model-driven semi-automated compliance framework. The novelty of the framework is the key participation of domain experts to author regulatory rules in a controlled natural language to enable compliance checking. We demonstrate transformation of regulations present in legal natural language text (English) to a model form via authoring of Structured English rules in the context of MMSR regulations for a large European bank. This generated regulatory model is eventually translated to formal logic that enables formal compliance checking contrary to current industry practice, that provides content management-based, document-driven and expert-dependent ways of managing regulatory compliance.

              Background
              
                Conventional calibration of the gamma camera consists of the calculation of calibration factors (CFs) (ratio of counts/cc and true concentration activity) as the function of the volume of interest (VOI). However, such method shows inconsistent results when the background activity varies. The aim of the present study was to propose a new calibration method by considering the sphere-to-background counts/voxel ratio (SBVR) in addition to the VOI for CFs calculation. A PET cylindrical flood phantom, a NEMA IQ body phantom, a Data spectrum Torso Phantom (ECT/TOR/P) and a LK-S Kyoto Liver/Kidney phantom were used. The NEMA IQ phantom was used to calibrate the camera and to produce CFs for the different spheres volumes and for varying sphere-to-background activity ratios. The spheres were filled with a uniform activity concentration of
                177
                Lu, while the background was first filled with cold water and activity was added between each SPECT scan. SPECT imaging was performed for 30-s, 20-s, and 10-s exposure per view. The calculated CFs were expressed as function of the sphere volume and SBVR. The obtained CFs were validated for an additional NEMA IQ acquisition with different activities in spheres and background and for the Torso and Liver/Kidney phantoms with inserted NEMA IQ spheres. The quantification accuracy was compared with the conventional method not taking SBVR into consideration.
              
            
            
              Results
              The relative errors in quantification using the NEMA IQ phantom with the new calibration method were 0.16%, 5.77%, 9.34% for the large, medium and small sphere, respectively, for a time per view of 30-s. The conventional calibration method gave errors of 3.65%, 6.65%, 30.28% for 30-s. The LK-S Kyoto Liver/Kidney Phantom resulted in quantification errors of 3.40%, 2.14%, 11.18% for the large, medium and small spheres, respectively, for 30-s; compared to 11.31%, 17.54%, 14.43% for 30-s, respectively, for the conventional method. Similar results were obtained for shorter acquisitions times with 20-s and 10-s time per view.
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                These results suggest that SBVR allows to improve quantification accuracy. The shorter time-per-view acquisitions had similar relative differences compared to the full-time acquisition which allows shorter imaging times with
                177
                Lu and improved patient comfort. The SBVR method is simple to set up and can be proposed for standardization.

TI  - Tumor dosimetry using 177Lu: influence of background activity, measurement method and reconstruction algorithm
AU  - Staanum, Peter Frøhlich
T2  - EJNMMI Physics
AB  - Abstract
            
              Background
              
                Image-based tumor dosimetry after radionuclide therapy, using the isotope
                177
                Lu, finds application e.g., for tumor-to-organ dose comparison and for dose response evaluation. When the tumor extent is not much larger than the image resolution, and when
                177
                Lu is found in nearby organs or other tumors, an accurate determination of tumor dose is particularly challenging. Here a quantitative evaluation of three different methods for determining the
                177
                Lu activity concentration in a phantom is performed, and the dependence on a variety of parameters is described. The phantom (NEMA IEC body phantom) has spheres of different size in a background volume, and sphere-to-background
                177
                Lu activity concentration ratios of infinity, 9.5, 5.0 and 2.7 are applied. The methods are simple to implement and well-known from the literature. They are based on (1) a large VOI encompassing the whole sphere, without background activity and with volume information from other sources, (2) a small VOI located in the sphere center, and (3) a VOI consisting of voxels with voxel value above a certain percentage of the maximum voxel value.
              
            
            
              Results
              The determined activity concentration varies significantly with sphere size, sphere-to-background ratio, SPECT reconstruction method and method for determining the concentration. Based on the phantom study, criteria are identified under which the activity concentration can be determined with a maximal error of 40% even in the presence of background activity.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Tumor dosimetry is feasible in the presence of background activity using the above-mentioned methods, provided appropriate SPECT reconstructions are applied and tumors are selected for dosimetry analysis according to the following criteria for the three methods: (1) solitary tumor with diameter > 15 mm, (2) tumor diameter > 30 mm and tumor-to-background ratio > 2, and (3) tumor diameter > 30 mm and tumor-to-background ratio > 3.

AB  - Abstract
            Declarative process modelling languages focus on describing a process by restrictions over the behaviour, which must be satisfied throughout the whole process execution. Hence, they are well suited for modelling knowledge-intensive processes with many decision points. However, such models can be hard to read and understand, which affect the modelling and maintenance of the process models tremendously as well as their execution. When executing such declarative (multi-perspective) process models, it may happen that the execution of activities or the change of data values may result in the non-executability of crucial activities. Hence, it would be beneficial to know all consequences of decisions to give recommendations to the process participants. A look-ahead attempts to predict the effects of executing an activity towards possible consequences within an a priori defined time window. The prediction is based on the current state of the process execution, the intended next event and the underlying process model. While execution engines for single-perspective imperative process models already implement such functionality, execution approaches, for multi-perspective declarative process models that involve constraints on data and resources, are less mature. In this paper, we introduce a simulation-based look-ahead approach for multi-perspective declarative process models. This approach transforms the problem of a context-aware process simulation into a SAT problem, by translating a declarative multi-perspective process model and the current state of a process execution into a specification of the logic language Alloy. Via a SAT solver, process trajectories are generated that either satisfy or violate this specification. The simulated process trajectories are used to derive consequences and effects of certain decisions at any time of process execution. We evaluate our approach by means of three examples and give some advice for further optimizations.

AB  - This research demonstrates the feasibility of using enterprise ontologies as representation formalism for automated validation of Enterprise Architecture (EA) principles. EA Principles are usually described in natural language, while the Enterprise Architecture is represented with graphical models. As both are intended for human interpretation, it requires humans to validate whether EA Principles are satisfied by an Enterprise Architecture. This is a complex and time-consuming process. We describe a step-by-step procedure for transforming the knowledge of Enterprise Architecture models and the vocabulary of EA Principles into the ArchiMEO ontology, which allows for automated validation. The approach is evaluated in two case studies. They confirm that an ontology-based validation of EA Principles is applicable in reality.

AB  - The rise in both the complexity and volume of regulations in the regulatory landscape have contributed to an increase in the awareness of the level of automation necessary for becoming fully compliant. Nevertheless, the question of how exactly to become fully compliant by adhering to all necessary laws and regulations remains. This paper presents a human-centred, knowledge-driven approach to regulatory reporting. A given regulation is represented in a controlled natural language form including its metadata and bindings, with the assistance of subject matter experts. This representation of a semi-formal controlled natural language translates into a self-executable formal representation via a context-free grammar. A meta reasoner with the knowledge to execute the given self-executable formal representation while generating regulatory reports including explanations on derived results has been developed. Finally, the proposed approach has been implemented as a prototype and validated in the realm of financial regulation: Money Market Statistical Reporting Regulation.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to generate a referent graph for semantic business vocabulary and rules. Graphs have many applications in social media, Google map and search engine to locate a specific goal. In social media websites, friends are linked to other friends, Google map help to search a specific location, path and distance from specific location, search engine are used to make a specific search, all these task are performed by used of referent graph. Semantic business vocabulary and rules are the standards from object management group for the business organization to form the polices and rules. On the based of these rules business organization develop different software from software industry to make transaction globally. But these rules are complex and ambiguous, cause misunderstanding and miscommunication for the software developer. Our used approach give the solution of this problem, to make a representation of semantic vocabulary and rules in form of referent graph, visual representation of these rules.

AB  - Business rules play an important role in software development. They are usually expressed in natural language, sometimes with the use of sentence templates such as RuleSpeak. The rules should be consistent with other artifacts representing the same domain, e.g. business glossary. Typically, business rules are written in a text editor. Such editors only offer basic support such as grammar spelling. They do not check compliance of business rules with a business glossary or more complex artifacts, e.g. domain diagrams. The goal of this paper is to propose a method of compatibility checking of business rules expressed in natural language with the domain specification. Checking is done at the syntax level. It is assumed that the domain is specified by a class diagram and a glossary. The compatibility checking is a heuristic method, the usefulness of which has been demonstrated by several experiments. At that point, the method application is limited to business rules relating to at most two classes and/or two attributes/roles.

AB  - Correct and complete aviation data is a prerequisite for SWIM cross-domain information sharing, which will affect the correct operation of the application program of the air traffic control system. The current syntax-based data verification method can verify the good structure of AIXM exchange documents. And rule constraints are usually in raw textual form and cannot be automatically enforced in computerized systems. This paper proposes an automated data semantic verification method for business rules based on SBVR, constructs the semantic rules meta-model of AIXM data, forms a set of AIXM business rules writing methods, and realizes the coding conversion path for implementing this method into system development, which supports automatic verification of more complex business logic and rule constraints.

AB  - The Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) model, adopted from the SBVR standard within an Object Management Group (OMG), is a rule-based specification. The SBVR model is proposed for specifying multiple interactions in service choreographies. It includes specifying the ordering constraints of global messages exchanged, alternative and concurrent interactions that occur between multiple participating services. It has been observed that unexpected messages exchanged occur in service choreographies when rule-based choreography specification (the SBVR model) involves the logical operator. This paper concerns about the unexpected circumstances in the service interaction when applying inclusive disjunction, OR in the SBVR rules specifications. The SBVR rules define the choreography specifications through the construction of a logical formulation consisting of atomic formulations, modality, logical operations, and quantification. The role binding of logical formulation and the “Sets” definition according to the OMG standard are applied to the SBVR model for service choreographies. These two elements contribute to the factors in the accuracy of the meaning for specifying the intended interaction.

AB  - Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rule (SBVR) were introduced to describe the business process in most formal way. SBVR specify business rules. Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules is introduced by standard of Object Management Group (OMG) in 2008. Complex business rules are formally defined by Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR). This paper provides a novel approach for translating SBVR specification of software requirements into XML schema. The purpose of this paper is to generate XML from SBVR instead of NL natural language specification because due to informal nature of natural language the generation of XML form NL will be resulted in lesser accuracy. SBVR Bridge the gap between humans and machines as human can understand simple natural language sentences while this natural language has ambiguous nature for machine and IT specialists. The VeTIS tool is used for the transformation purpose. SBVR rules generated as first output and these rules gave as input to transaction editor that extract SBVR vocabulary such as noun concept, fact type etc. In the last step these SBVR elements are replaced by elements that are called tags of XML vocabulary.

AB  - Business rules specify the required or desirable states of affairs or behavior of IT systems, and typically involve deontic constraints that must be adequately specified to enable their appropriate representation and effective analysis. Such deontic constraints focus on the permitted actions and obligations of the agents to carry them out. In this paper we present a proposal to explicitly specify dynamic deontic constraints in UML and OCL so that, on the one hand, they can guide and restrict the system behavior and, on the other hand, allow us to reason about such deontic behavior, including accountability analysis.

AB  - We consider current Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO) Action Rules Specification to be unnecessarily complex and ambiguous. Even while using a “structured English” syntax similar to the one used in Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR), such specifications are: incomplete while not containing enough ontological information to derive a functional implementation; and complex by containing mostly unneeded specifications. We propose a new meta-model for DEMO’s Action Model in the form of an Extended Backus–Naur Form (EBNF) syntax which is being implemented in a prototype that directly executes DEMO models as an Information and Workflow System. This prototype includes an action engine that runs DEMO transactions and the enclosed actions specified in our approach. We are currently integrating Blockly in our solution to allow syntactically correct visual programming of our proposed new Action Rule language that includes constructs to evaluate logical conditions, update the state of internal or external information systems, obtain input and provide output (formatted with a ‘What You See Is What You Get’ (WYSIWYG) template editor) to users, among others.

AB  - Business rules are generally captured in a natural language. The inherit ambiguity of the latter is often seen as a cause for project failure, which makes it necessary to translate natural language business rules statements to another language sufficiently formal. However, business experts are generally not familiar with formal languages, which can complicate the communication between stakeholders. For this reason, Object Management Group (OMG) had proposed SBVR Standard (2008) for modeling complex organizations in a natural language but in a formal and detailed way. As a result, several studies have succeeded to increase the accuracy of their approaches by transforming their models from/to SBVR standard. Clearly then, the success of these approaches depends on the quality of the SBVR based statements used or generated. This paper presents an approach for checking conformance of both lexicon and syntax of Business Rules (BR) expressed with Semantic of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR), to SBVR Structured English notation (SBVR-SE) using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

AB  - The article presents a proposal of the formal symbolic notation operate for basic mathematical concepts. This notation is distinguished by its unambiguousness in terms of key terms used in computer science. This notation defines many concepts such as entity, type, structure definition, compositional relationship and aggregation relationship, references, features related to the admission of variation, ordering, uniqueness, generalisation-specialisation relationship, inheritance, and polymorphism mechanism. Purely mathematical notation operates on concepts that are blurry in the sense of computer science. Moreover, in mathematics, there are no direct mechanisms such as inheritance or polymorphism. They can be defined mathematically in many ways, which can sometimes make it difficult to understand such formalisms in the context of computer science solutions. The proposed solution is a response to a research problem defined in this way. The article also presents a case study illustrating how to apply the proposed method.

AB  - This work investigates how to generate RDFS based knowledge graph from SBVR. Semantic web is developed the idea of Resource description Framework (RDF). Knowledge graph is collection of interconnected entities. We required RDF knowledge graph because we want to show the date, which represented in graph. RDF vocabulary is used to provide description of instances. RDF can be constructed by three components subject, object, and predicate in which subject and object are resources while predicate is the property which describe the relationship between these resources. In this paper we represented that how we Generate an RDFS based knowledge graph from SBVR Semantic of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) in a way that it is easy to machine process. We used SBVR Tool and described that with the help of that tool SBVR to RDF transformation is possible. In this method SBVR is our input, SBVR is a textual representation, we used SBVR rules and create triple (subject object predicate) and then generate RDF and RDFS.

AB  - In requirement engineering (RE) for agile software development, the Class-Responsibility-Collaborator (CRC) models are used as important brainstorming tool. However, manual generation of such CRC models by analyzing the requirements is a difficult and time-consuming task due to ambiguity and informal nature of natural languages-based software requirements. This paper introduces an improved requirement engineering technique based on CRC models that can help in specifying and analyzing software requirements in a better and faster way and curtailing difficulties associated with the traditional RE analysis technique. The proposed technique employs Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) to capture and specify software requirements in a controlled natural language. The SBVR representation is processed to extract object-oriented information and map the extracted information to CRC models in both textual and visual form. The proposed approach is implemented as an Eclipse plugin prototype SBVR2CRC as a proof of concept and the results of the experiments validate the effectiveness of the presented approach. Results show that such automated approach not only saves certain time and effort but also assists in generation of better CRC models and simplifies the CRC models based agile software development.

AB  - The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes different requirements for data controllers collecting personal data to protect individuals’ privacy. This fact triggered many studies and projects to investigate Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) for the fulfillment of the compliance requirements. In this paper, after reviewing some of the current challenges and gaps in GDPR compliance, we argue the use of Semantic Technologies in PETs in the form of an Intelligent Compliance Agent (ICA) to support data controllers in carrying out a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). Models and ontologies representing entities involved in the DPIA process can help data controllers determine the risk of their processing activities. Additionally, an inference engine, equipped with a knowledge base of DPIA-related obligations, can effectively assist data controllers in taking specific actions when a legal fact is triggered based on met conditions.

AB  - Every modern organization nowadays produces data and consumes information through Decision-Support Systems (DSS) which produce more and more Complex Performance Indicators (CPI). This allows business monitoring, decision-making support and tracking of decisions effects. With the increasing complexity, DSS suffer from two main limitations that inhibit their use. First, DSS tend to be opaque to Business Managers who cannot observe how the data is treated to produce indicators. Second, DSS are owned by the technicians, resulting in an IT-bottleneck and a business-exclusion. From a Business Management perspective, the consequences are damaging. DSS result in sunk costs of development, fail to receive full confidence from Business Managers and to fit dynamic business environments. In this research, preliminary insights are proposed to build a solution that tackles the previous limitations. The literature review, the research contributions and methodology are presented to conclude with the work plan of the PhD.

AB  - Decision and process descriptions often find themselves encapsulated in long descriptions such as regulations or guidelines. Decision modelling aims at modelling the structure and logic of a decision. For decision modellers, analysing textual documents in search for relevant sentences is a time consuming activity. A promising research topic is to build decision models from text. In this paper, an automatic decision modelling component classifier using deep learning is proposed. Using a large dataset consisting of labeled sentences, the usability of deep learning techniques is investigated. In total three deep learning techniques are evaluated and compared to non-deep learning techniques using both Bag of Words and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. We conclude that classifying decision modelling components is possible and report that BERT for sequence classification is the best performing technique.

AB  - The majority of requirements formalisation techniques operate on textual requirements as input. To establish and verify the reliability and coverage of such techniques, a large set of textual requirements with diverse structures and formats is required. However, such techniques are typically evaluated on only a few manually curated requirements that do not provide enough coverage of the targeted structures. Motivated by this problem, we introduce a Component-oriented synthetic textual requirements generator (CORG) that can generate large numbers of synthesised diverse-structure textual requirements, along with key components breakdowns. CORG utilises a controlled random-selection (CRS) strategy throughout the backtracking-based generation. We evaluate the coverage, diversity, performance and correctness of CORG. The evaluation results show that CORG can generate comprehensive diverse-structure combinations in reasonable time without being affected by the size of the produced requirements.

AB  - The service choreography approach has been proposed for the declarative specification of multi-party conversations between participant services, in service-oriented applications and web transactions. Constraint solvers such as Alloy Analyzer can be used for the automated generation and verification of declarative choreography specifications. This presumes a mapping between the declarative specification of business rules in Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR), an OMG standard for specifying business models in structured English, and the Alloy Analyzer which is a SAT based constraint solver. This paper is concerned with the correctness of such mapping between the generated instance (choreography) in Alloy and the global graph obtained as a direct visual representation of the SBVR model specification.

AB  - The availability of pertinent, accurate, and useful information has become essential to people and organisations in their collaborations with others. Enterprise architecture provides stakeholder-oriented frameworks and methods supporting producing and consuming information products that satisfy collaborating stakeholders’ concerns. However, while stakeholder analysis suggests identifying relationships between stakeholder and their practices, this has not yet been incorporated in the enterprise architecture standard ISO 42010 and frameworks such as TOGAF. The current lack of support for relationships between stakeholder practices limits analysis and right-sizing of the use of information products in a multi-stakeholder environment, where stakeholders collaborate while having different, possibly divergent, interests, work to be done, goals, and information needs over time. This paper presents a situation viewpoint that can be used to extend stakeholder analysis in enterprise architecture framework with relationships to improve the understanding of why and how information products are used in constellations of stakeholders where each stakeholder plays a role. The situation viewpoint aims to improve the relevance, design, tailoring, effectiveness, evolution, and evaluation of information products such as models.

AB  - The paper is focused on comparison of two different approaches to graph modeling. A case study, which was chosen as a common background for the comparison, is an example of modeling problems characteristic for bioinformatics. First the OMG Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) standard was used to define the domain. The Association-Oriented Database (AODB) metamodel based approach was applied to show how the appropriate domain-specific model can be created in a graph modeling language dedicated to data modeling. In contrast, the Context-Driven Meta-Modeling (CDMM) approach, illustrates how to construct a domain-specific modeling language to model the case-study as a domain. The AODB is used as a General-Purpose Modeling Language (GPML) while the CDMM is applied as a Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML). Both approaches constitute alternatives for MOF based languages known from OMG standards.

AB  - Considering the potential of collaborative business as a trend, we start from the assumption that collaborations between companies have a higher success rate if a good compatibility from process perspective is detected. The solution is based on the business processes used internally in all participating organizations to collaborations with common business objectives. For un-standardized organizations, we used process mining techniques to formalize processes and to attach them to business scenarios. The process models are reduced to graph format and graph comparison algorithms are used to compute a compatibility factor. Syntactic similarity is unfeasible for real business process comparison in an un-standardized environment. Semantic similarity is resource consuming and could lead to un-predictable results. We propose in the current paper a methodology based on domain specific ontology to calculate the similarity between organizations from process perspective and to offer a collaborative solution, business process based.

AB  - Automated extraction of semantic information from textual descriptions can be implemented by processing results of application of Stanford CoreNLP tools. This paper presents a sequence of processing steps and initial results of their application for two examples of a description of system’s functionality. The processing steps allow identifying main functional characteristics of the system and its operational domain. Results obtained as a result of application of the steps are compared with data obtained as a result of analysis by a developer. Application of Stanford CoreNLP parsers in certain cases can produce errors and can influence results of further processing. The comparison of the two results sets showed that variability of language constructs in descriptions affects an amount of implicitly expressed knowledge. Nevertheless, results of this research can be used as a start point of automated text processing for creation of analysis models.

AB  - The domain model is one the most important artifacts produced at early stages of software development which can be reused efficiently during software design and implementation. Unfortunately, there is no clear explanation what should be included in the domain model to minimize modeling effort and maximize the potential later benefits. Authors of the paper try to address this gap by proposing a definition of a unified domain meta-model, which is the result of literature overview and authors’ own experiences. The purpose of the literature analysis was to assess the existing definitions of domain models and to identify their common parts. On that basis, a unified meta-model was proposed. Its application in real projects confirmed the meta-model usefulness.

However, these areas evolve separately despite the great number of researches that focus on improving realisation project’ techniques. Thus, our approach aims to provide an approach that combines two variants of MDE, Model Driven Architecture approach and Model-Based Testing with the V development lifecycle used in every scrum Agile Methodology sprint to deal with system evolution. In order to well illustrate this approach, we apply it on Rental Car Agency System realisation using Scrum methodology with some requirements’ evolution.

AB  - For e-commerce retailers it is crucial to present their products both informatively and attractively. Virtual reality (VR) systems represent a new marketing tool that supports customers in their decision-making process and offers an extraordinary product experience. Despite these advantages, the use of this technology for e-commerce retailers is also associated with risks, namely cybersickness. The aim of the study is to investigate the occurrence of cybersickness in the context of the customer’s perceived enjoyment and the perceived challenge of a VR product presentation. Based on a conceptual research framework, a laboratory study with 533 participants was conducted to determine the influence of these factors on the occurrence of cybersickness. The results demonstrate that the perceived challenge has a substantially stronger impact on the occurrence of cybersickness, which can only be partially reduced by perceived enjoyment. When realizing VR applications in general and VR product presentations in particular, e-commerce retailers should therefore first minimize possible challenges instead of focusing primarily on entertainment aspects of such applications.

AB  - Elicitation is the entry point of any digital transformation project. Domain knowledge is a critical factor for successful elicitation. Hence, elicitation is usually executed by subject matter experts (SME), who have fair amount of domain knowledge required for the project. However, such SME are scare and costly resources. Hence there is an urgent need to design a framework that can help build domain knowledge of the business analyst (BA) involved in elicitation in order to lower dependence on SME. Such framework should be programmatically implementable and should be able to work seamlessly with the existing techniques of elicitation. Several solutions based on organizational theories, cognitive models, and strategic frameworks have been proposed with varying results. This work is in progress. As elicitation generates a web of interactions in natural language, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be utilized to extract and build domain knowledge. This paper investigates the application of NLP to extract working domain knowledge from the available organizational documents to assist analyst during elicitation phase. The paper proposes a conceptual framework to extract and build domain familiarity. This paper also analyzes the gaps and new areas of research in this direction.

AB  - The importance and adoption of Blockchain to support secure and trusted collaborations between businesses continues to grow. In today’s practice, most Blockchain smart contracts (which capture the business processing logic) are written primarily by software developers. To enable widespread adoption of Blockchain, business analysts and subject matter experts will need to have direct access to the smart contract logic, including the abilities to understand, modify, and create substantial portions of that logic. This paper describes a fully functioning framework and system for specifying and executing smart contracts in which the core logic is specified by a controlled English, business-level rules language. The framework includes a browser-based smart editor for rules; a parser generator that enables substantial variation in the rules syntax; code generation that maps to a RETE based rules engine; and execution of the rules in either on-chain (using Hyperledger Fabric) or off-chain modes. The paper describes the rules framework and possible extensions, and identifies key aspects of Blockchain that impact the implementation.

AU  - Rutledge, Lloyd

AB  - We propose patterns of the Fresnel semantic browser interface language specifically for business rules violations. Such mapping between rule logic and violation enforcement makes rule system development more flexible, efficient and reliable. We also propose an extension to Fresnel to enable this. Managing business rules independently from presentation using rule styles adds flexibility and efficiency to information system development. We demonstrate our technique by applying it to the EU-Rent case. An existing EU-Rent implementation in the relation algebra-based system Ampersand serves as an example for restriction of input values and display parameters in the interface. Another existing EU-Rent implementation provides Semantic Web inferencing for rule logic. We apply our proposed inference patterns to this implementation. These inferences then apply to our proposed patterns of Fresnel. Finally, we demonstrate the resulting system interface with mock-ups on Semantic MediaWiki.

AB  - Praxeme is an enterprise methodology designed to overcome the difficulties associated with the construction of enterprise information systems. The aspect that specifies the company’s intentions represents the initial phase of the software development process in Praxeme. The use of the eLEL lexicon to express the intentional aspect of Praxeme enables the knowledge in the following aspects to be clarified. However, the logical modeling (logical aspect) from the intentional aspect represented by eLEL is largely lacking in conceptual information to be exploited in the purely IT aspect of Praxeme. In this paper, we propose the use of the ReLEL lexicon to specify the intentional aspect of Praxeme in order to automate the process covering the business and IT aspects of the enterprise. ReLEL is an enterprise terminology database and has precise information concerning the conceptual representation of an information system. For this purpose, we have proposed rules to automate the articulation that covers the intentional, semantic, logical and software aspects of Praxeme. We made use of the ATL and Acceleo language for the implementation of the transformation rules. The result obtained in this article is a SOAP web service of the software aspect of Praxeme.

AB  - Software Testing is a process of investigating a software product to identify possible mismatches between expected and implemented system requirements. One of the main motivations of software testing is to ensure the correctness of a software system. Thus, due to the continuous quest for better quality of software system, the efforts spent on testing phase are enormous and costly toward both the user and the developer. Many tools and approaches were proposed to solve this problem. Model-Based Testing (MBT) is one of the new technologies to meet the challenges imposed on software testing. Compared to traditional testing methods, MBT is able to manage and accomplish testing tasks in a cheaper and more efficient way. MBT relies on models of the system under test and/or its environment to derive test cases for the system. Models can be used in different manners and for different purposes such as improving specifications quality, code generation, and test generation. In this paper, we use models as the core element of our approach that aims to generate test cases for the different abstraction levels of MDA development life cycle. Our approach uses UML diagrams and Semantic Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) to model MDA levels then we propose transformations to generate test cases in order to evaluate if the generated code fulfills system requirements. We aim to implement transformations in an Eclipse plugin.

AB  - Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard graphical notation that is widely used for modeling Business Processes (BP) in Business Process Management (BPM) systems. A key application of such systems is continuous analysis of BP execution for checking compliance of execution logs with process models. In this paper we introduce a simple, human-readable rule language based on a fragment of First-Order Logic (FOL) and show how compliance rules can be generated directly from BPMN models. We focus on control flow aspects of BPMN models by (1) transforming the model to obtain a uniform representation of task activation (2) dividing the model into sets of components and (3) using our proposed language to generate compliance rules for each component. We show that these rules can be used in the analysis of the business process execution log using British Telecom’s Aperture business process analysis tool.

AB  - Knowledge-intensive Processes are difficult to support by traditional workflow oriented Business Process Management approaches. Reasons lie in in ad-hoc decisions and unpredictable workflows that come with them. Adaptive Case Management (ACM) is a paradigm for the management of knowledge-intensive processes that has recently drawn attention in industry and the scientific community. This development led to the standardization of CMMN as a notation for process models for the ACM implementation. This study assess the availability of method support for the use of ACM and the fitness of CMMN for fulfilling the modeling requirements in this context based on a systematic literature review. As a result missing method support, CMMN shortcomings as well as suggestions for the implementation of ACM in combination with CMMN are discussed.

AB  - Data retrieval is a mandatory and universal process that is used by almost every digital deployment for their application-specific use cases. Researchers have developed various machine learning models to facilitate highly efficient, fast, low complexity, and multisource data retrieval techniques. But due to a wide variation in input data types there is a huge variation in deployment of these techniques. For instance, text retrieval techniques require estimation of distance metrics, while audio and image retrieval techniques require estimation of correlation metrics, and video retrieval techniques use recursive correlation for retrieval of video sequences. Furthermore, these strategies differ internally in terms of their qualitative and quantitative properties, making it challenging for researchers to find the best retrieval techniques for their application-specific use cases. For instance, audio and text retrieval models use 1D data representation and retrieval techniques, while image and video processing models use 2D, 3D & 4D based techniques, which causes ambiguity in model selection for real-time use cases. This study describes some of the recently presented data retrieval strategies and evaluates their deployment-specific nuances, application-specific advantages, functional lacunas, and perspective future research objectives to lessen model selection uncertainty. Researchers will have the ability to discover retrieving models with higher functional capabilities for application-specific use cases as a result of this debate. The effectiveness of these models was then studied by comparing performance indicators such as retrieval delay, retrieval accuracy, computational overhead, scalability, and installation cost parameters. This text also proposes the evaluation of a novel Data Retrieval Metric (DRM), which combines these evaluation parameters, and assists in identification of high-performance models suited for large-scale deployments.

AB  - Cloud computing (CC) imposed its presence in various domains as a computing model based on what it offers for enterprises. ERP systems as a domain is one of the beneficiary domains of SaaS applications. Eliciting requirements for cloud ERP systems is a challenging process due to the complex nature of ERP systems in addition to the distributed nature of CC. Most of the current techniques for eliciting ERP requirements do not take into consideration working in cloud environments. This paper is concerned with automating the requirements elicitation process for cloud-based ERPs. It also presents an interactive prototype to be used in a distributed environment, which uses the principals of the Form-Based Model (FBM). We use a real-life case study to demonstrate the automation process.

AB  - In regulated safety-critical domains, such as the aerospace and nuclear domains, certification bodies often require systems to undergo a stringent safety assessment procedure to show their compliance to one or more safety standards. Assurance cases are an emerging way of communicating safety of a safety-critical system in a structured and comprehensive manner. Due to the significant complexity of the required materials, software tools are often used as a practical way of constructing assurance cases. This paper presents the first, to the best of our knowledge, systematic review of assurance case tools. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive list of assurance case tools developed over the past 20 years and an analysis of their functionalities.

AB  - In this paper, we present ten principles that, in our view, underlie and define the practice and science of ‘Fact Based Thinking’. In itself, Fact Based Thinking underpins Fact Based Modelling (FBM) in all its forms. FBM has been around for decades, and has brought forth a number of meta-models and formalizations. The principles as discussed in this paper focus on Fact Based Thinking rather than on matters of representation and precise semantics, which have been elaborately discussed elsewhere. The principles presented are deliberately worded for broad use and inspirational purposes, rather than worked out in detail. As such, this paper suggests the initialization of further work rather than presenting a final result. The sketch of the principles presented aims to express the basics of Fact Based Thinking in a way that most members of the FBM community can feel at home with.

AB  - This contribution studies testing behavioral aspects of a given UML and OCL model. In our approach, a so-called model validator can automatically generate test cases (object models) by using configurations for the object models and manually formulated OCL invariants. But expressing OCL invariants can be complex and difficult, especially for novel or occasional modelers. In this contribution, we present an approach to automatically transform a diagrammatic test case schema into a corresponding OCL invariant. The schema is a visual representation of a behavioral test scenario constructed by the developer and which is instantiated by the model validator to achieve different concrete test cases. This approach enhances the underlying testing technique in making it developer-friendly and independent of OCL expertise.

AB  - The first step to understanding the need at the level of the information system in a company is to find tools, means of communication, or a simple modeling language that provides notations such as diagrams that are Clearly readable called BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), the language that can satisfy the needs of internal organizations and facilitate collaboration between the components of the company. Our paper proposes a transformation based on the (model-driven architecture) MDA approach that will help us to save time, and money and to have a solid information system, up to date and consistent which ensures the passage of information between simple users and IT developers. As a start, we focus on a transformation carried out with QVT (views query transformations), between the BPMN diagram and the class diagram of UML (unified modeling language) which is a more sophisticated, specific modeling language and which will allow us to carry out other transformations to achieve other goals.

AB  - Early phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) like requirements elicitation and model design are often critical for the project success. These phases are also linked to several project problems and failure causes, delaying the project finalization and increasing its total cost. Several strategies to mitigate the effects of errors in these early stages have been proposed. Some of these include: GUI based fast prototyping; agile software development methodologies; and, as in this work, automatic model (or source code) generation from a natural language specification. Although these approaches can reduce production time and costs, they can also be slow and imprecise leading to development difficulties. This work proposes an approach to obtain a functional prototype of a web-based process-oriented information system, using only a restricted natural language specification as an input. This approach allows the processing of the input to be faster and more precise than the approaches proposed previously. Two case studies are presented in order to validate the proposal and demonstrate its applicability.

AB  - This paper proposes a suitable technique for the generation of Unified Modeling Diagrams (UML) from textual information using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep learning concepts. The deep learning technologies can be used for the text analytics to improve and automate the UML diagram preparation. This technique initially focuses on the generation of consolidated design model from which the class model can be constructed. Here the class names, attributes, and associations are identified based on certain heuristic rules. Also the proposed method is evaluated and compared with certain known methods. In this paper generation of UML diagrams from textual information using NLP is discussed with the concepts of deep learning. The proposed algorithm is able to identify the required objects, attributes, relationships, etc., which will be specified by the user for the preparation of UML diagrams. This is possible by the various generation principles. Initially generation of consolidated design model is acquired and from that the class model is derived. Different features like class names, attributes, and associations are identified by heuristic rules. The proposed method is compared with conventional methods and it shows an improvement in accuracy from 4.1% to 8.7%.

AB  - The power of Model Driven Architecture (MDA) lies in the use of models and diagrams in the visualization and development processes of enterprise information systems. This is why we have chosen the Business Process Model and Notations (BPMN), because of its simple diagram symbols and clear notations, allowing all simple users of information systems within the organization to quickly and easily understand their needs and goals. In our paper, we propose to connect all categories of personnel within an organization, regardless of their specialty, with IT developers using the agile methodology, while moving from BPMN diagrams as a standalone IT model to the Unified Modeling Language (UML) use case modeling diagram as a platform independent model. We chose the latter as our destination because of its development and the possibility of turning it into a powerful, integrated program. In addition, for future completions, we chose Query View Transformations (QVT) for security reasons, as it is consistent with previous programs and languages of the same family.

AB  - This works presents a novel approach to generate PROV-O [3] automatically by using triples. Managing provenance manually is on greater risk of human error and tracing it, validating it and mapping is very complex and time-consuming process. So, in this work we develop a system which automatically generates OWL [4] and PROV-O [3]. In developed approach we import OWL [4] ontology built in protégé and parses this ontology by using OWL API in eclipse. Then identify the areas where provenance is needed and input the PROV-O [3] tags. Now embed PROV-O [3] tags in ontology, then verify consistency and get the PROV-O [3] output. We have effectively performed many experiments and evaluations on various Ontologies with the help of our proposed approach. Hence, in context of usability, correctness and time the results we can get are clearly show the effectiveness of our system.

AB  - Modelling in a knowledge base of logic formulæ the articles of the GDPR enables a semi-automatic reasoning of the Regulation. To be legally substantiated, it requires that the formulæ express validly the legal meaning of the Regulation’s articles. But legal experts are usually not familiar with logic, and this calls for an interdisciplinary validation methodology that bridges the communication gap between formal modelers and legal evaluators. We devise such a validation methodology and exemplify it over a knowledge base of articles of the GDPR translated into Reified I/O (RIO) logic and encoded in LegalRuleML. A pivotal element of the methodology is a human-readable intermediate representation of the logic formulæ that preserves the formulæ’s meaning, while rendering it in a readable way to non-experts. After being applied over a use case, we prove that it is possible to retrieve feedback from legal experts about the formal representation of Art. 5.1a and Art. 7.1. What emerges is an agile process to build logic knowledge bases of legal texts, and to support their public trust, which we intend to use for a logic model of the GDPR, called DAPRECO knowledge base.

AB  - The ability to effectively communicate decision rules becomes increasingly important, as the stake of multidisciplinary teams within organizations increases. With Decision Model and Notation (DMN) turning out to become one of the international standards for modelling decision rules, the need for effective communication of decision rules modelled using the standard grows. In order to facilitate this communication we present a structured verbalization for DMN decision tables, using principles of fact based thinking and modelling theory. This verbalization is designed to be fully interpretable by anyone that has knowledge about the described domain. The key to accommodating this interpretability is the use of a structured natural language as the foundation for the verbalization.

The Artefact, the result of a program which engineered and combined three methodologies, is developed on the basis of an emerging concept since 2009 and recently (in 2016) implemented in several information systems. Because of the availability of several implementations of the artefact, a post evaluation based on hypothesis testing of the real artefacts is a feasible and necessary next research step, on which will we elaborate in this paper. Rather than a research question, three hypotheses are proposed in this research.

AB  - The business process model and notation (BPMN) standard provides notations in the form of diagrams, which are clearly legible for the needs of internal organizations and facilitate collaboration between enterprise components. The problem is how to find a transformation solution between the BPMN and the UML (Unified modeling language) to benefit from the simplicity of the BPMN on the one hand, the stability and the widespread UML on the other hand. We work to have a high-performance solution within the framework of model-driven architecture (MDA) that saves time, cost and quality of the software. This article represents a transformation method that allows us to go through the BPMN business process diagram to arrive at the UML class diagram, finally, to generate the code automatically by using the query views transformations (QVT) transformation language, and this transformation is a fruitful combination between the trades side and the computer side.

AB  - A key challenge in making a transparent formalization of a legal text is the dependency on two domain experts. While a legal expert is needed in order to interpret the legal text, a logician or a programmer is needed for encoding it into a program or a formula. Various existing methods are trying to solve this challenge by improving or automating the communication between the two experts. In this paper, we follow a different direction and attempt to eliminate the dependency on the target domain expert. This is achieved by inverting the translation back into the original text. By skipping over the logical translation, a legal expert can now both interpret and evaluate a translation.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the teaching of enterprise modelling. Enterprise models play an increasingly important role in society. In general, such models are not created as mere “one off” artefacts. They rather have a life of their own, covering a broad range of uses (from analysis and understanding, via simulation and design, to execution and monitoring), while involving an even broader variety of stakeholders/audiences. In our view, this increased use of, and even increased dependence on, enterprise models, also makes it important to teach people how to model well.

AB  - We consider current Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO) Action Rules Specification to be unnecessarily complex and ambiguous. Even while using a “structured English” syntax similar to the one used in SBVR, such specifications are: incomplete while not containing enough ontological information to derive a functional implementation; and complex by containing mostly unneeded specifications. We propose a new meta-model for DEMO’s Action Model in the form of an EBNF syntax which is being implemented in a prototype that directly executes DEMO models as an Information and Workflow System. This prototype includes an action engine that runs DEMO transactions and the enclosed actions specified in our approach. We are currently integrating Blockly in our solution to allow syntactically correct visual programming of our proposed new Action Rule language that includes constructs to evaluate logical conditions, update the state of internal or external information systems, obtain input and provide output (formatted with WYSIWYG template editor) to users, among others.

AB  - Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a widely used standard for modeling and managing process knowledge among organizations. In this paper, we present a concept of a natural language description generator for business process models. Such a generator is expected to reduce the time it takes to describe a process work manually. It may also lower the risk of making a mistake during this task, especially when working on more complex models. The outcome of executing the proposed program is a description of the given business process written in the form of understandable sentences in the Polish language. Our results show that the generated descriptions reflect the original model of the given process, which means that its potential conversion back to the BPMN model will result in a model close to the original one.

AB  - Socialization is the essential building process of any society in natural ecosystems. Effective socialization processes have been investigated for both “biotic” (human) and “abiotic” (virtual) entities, also within digital ecosystems in the perspective of common and self-adaptive languages. In this paper, we propose an approach for socialization, language self-adaptation, and evolution that enables an effective communicative interaction among digital entities acting in a digital ecosystem. The proposed method relies on an adaptable and extensible grammatical formalism, named Digital Ecosystem Grammar (DEG). This grammar enables digital entities to interpret the messages sent by other entities by using interaction, learning and evolution actions. Moreover, a grammar learning algorithm is applied to provide the self-adaptation mechanisms that allow the digital environment to adapt the interaction language according to new messages. The approach was suitable to support the characteristics of self-adaptation, context-awareness, evolvability, and semanticity of a digital ecosystem language.

AU  - Kowalski, Robert
AU  - Satoh, Ken
T2  - Journal of Philosophical Logic
AB  - Formalising deontic concepts, such as obligation, prohibition and permission, is normally carried out in a modal logic with a possible world semantics, in which some worlds are better than others. The main focus in these logics is on inferring logical consequences, for example inferring that the obligation O q is a logical consequence of the obligations Op and O (p → q). In this paper we propose a non-modal approach in which obligations are preferred ways of satisfying goals expressed in first-order logic. To say that p is obligatory, but may be violated, resulting in a less than ideal situation s, means that the task is to satisfy the goal p ∨ s, and that models in which p is true are preferred to models in which s is true. Whereas, in modal logic, the preference relation between possible worlds is part of the semantics of the logic, in this non-modal approach, the preference relation between first-order models is external to the logic. Although our main focus is on satisfying goals, we also formulate a notion of logical consequence, which is comparable to the notion of logical consequence in modal deontic logic. In this formalisation, an obligation Op is a logical consequence of goals G, when p is true in all best models of G. We show how this non-modal approach to the treatment of deontic concepts deals with problems of contrary-to-duty obligations and normative conflicts, and argue that the approach is useful for many other applications, including abductive explanations, defeasible reasoning, combinatorial optimisation, and reactive systems of the production system variety.

AB  - This work presents our approach to formally model the Swiftaid system design, a digital platform that enables donors to automatically add Gift Aid to donations made via card payments. Following principles of Behaviour-Driven Development, we use Gherkin to capture requirements specified in legislation, specifically the UK Charity (Gift Aid Declarations) Regulations 2016. The Gherkin scenarios provide a basis for subsequent formal modelling and analysis using Event-B, Rodin and ProB. Interactive model simulations assist communication between domain experts, software architects and other stakeholders during requirements capture and system design, enabling the emergent system behaviour to be validated. Our approach was employed within the development of the real Swiftaid product, launched by Streeva in February 2019. Our analysis helped conclude that there was not a strong enough business case for one of the features, whichwas shown to provide nominal user convenience at the expense of increased complexity. This work provides a case study in allying formal and agile software development to enable rapid development of robust software.

AB  - Mature verification and monitoring approaches, such as complex event processing and model checking, can be applied for checking compliance specifications at design time and runtime. Little is known about the understandability of the different formal and technical languages associated with these approaches. This uncertainty regarding understandability might be a major obstacle for the broad practical adoption of those techniques. This article reports a controlled experiment with 215 participants on the understandability of modeling compliance specifications in representative modeling languages, namely linear temporal logic (LTL), the complex event processing-based event processing language (EPL) and property specification patterns (PSP). The formalizations in PSP were overall more correct. That is, the pattern-based approach provides a higher level of understandability than EPL and LTL. More advanced users, however, seemingly are able to cope equally well with PSP and EPL in modeling compliance specifications.

AB  - High-throughput imaging is highly desirable in intelligent analysis of computer vision tasks. In conventional design, throughput is limited by the separation between physical image capture and digital post processing. Computational imaging increases throughput by mixing analog and digital processing through the image capture pipeline. Yet, recent advances of computational imaging focus on the “compressive sampling”, this precludes the wide applications in practical tasks. This paper presents a systematic analysis of the next step for computational imaging built on snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) and semantic computer vision (SCV) tasks, which have independently emerged over the past decade as basic computational imaging platforms.

AB  - Process mining is an emerging discipline that aims to analyze business processes using event data logged by IT systems. In process mining, the focus is on how to effectively and efficiently predict the next process/trace to be activated among all the possible processes/traces that are available in the process schema (usually modeled as a graph). Most of the existing process mining techniques assume that there is a one-to-one mapping between process model activities and the events that are recorded during process execution. However, event logs and process model activities are at different level of granularity. In this paper, we present a machine-learning-based approach to map low-level event logs to high-level activities. With this work, we can bridge the abstraction levels when the high-level labels of the low-level events are not available. The proposed approach consists of two main phases: automatic labeling and machine-learning-based classification. In automatic labeling, a modified k-prototypes clustering approach has been used in order to obtain the labeled examples. Then, in the second phase, we trained different ML classifiers using the obtained labeled examples. Since, in real-life applications and systems, business processes are expressed according to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) format, we improve our proposed framework by means of an innovative, flexible BPMN model translation methodology that acts at the first phase. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed framework using two case studies with real-world event logs, and provide its experimental assessment and analysis.

T2  - Software and Systems Modeling
AB  - Due to hyper-competition, technological advancements, regulatory changes, etc, the conditions under which enterprises need to thrive become increasingly turbulent. Consequently, enterprise agility increasingly determines an enterprise’s chances for success. As software development often is a limiting factor in achieving enterprise agility, enterprise agility and software adaptability become increasingly intertwined. As a consequence, decisions that regard flexibility should not be left to software developers alone. By taking a Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) approach, starting from DEMO ontological enterprise models and explicit (enterprise) implementation design decisions, the aim of this research is to bridge the gap from enterprise agility to software adaptability, in such a way that software development is no longer a limiting factor in achieving enterprise agility. Low-code technology is a growing market trend that builds on MDSD concepts and claims to offer a high degree of software adaptability. Therefore, as a first step to show the potential benefits to use DEMO ontological enterprise models as a base for MDSD, this research shows the design of a mapping from DEMO models to Mendix for the (automated) creation of a low-code application that also intrinsically accommodates run-time implementation design decisions.

AB  - The importance of business process (BP) modeling to Business Process Management can be justified by the serious problems, which may arise in the latter, if the former is not conducted correctly. This can take place, for instance, in the case of an inappropriate choice of a BP modeling formalism. Many frameworks have therefore been proposed in order to guide the selection of the most suitable formalism. Nevertheless, these research efforts still scattered throughout a wide range of publications, unlinked and often with a narrow scope. Hence, there is a need for both a combination of these research labors into a single reference source and an approach to support such combination. This paper is the first contribution toward responding to this need. It proposes a methodological roadmap as a basis for developing a selection support system. The results presented in the current paper stand for a first step toward a reference framework for helping researchers and practitioners in choosing the most appropriate BP modeling formalism given a set of contextual variables. The proposed methodological roadmap is specified using a modeling formalism (MAP) which considers the “decision” as a first-class citizen.

AU  - Kowalski, Robert

T2  - Artificial Intelligence and Law
AB  - In this paper, we present an informal introduction to Logical English (LE) and illustrate its use to standardise the legal wording of the Automatic Early Termination (AET) clauses of International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Agreements. LE can be viewed both as an alternative to conventional legal English for expressing legal documents, and as an alternative to conventional computer languages for automating legal documents. LE is a controlled natural language (CNL), which is designed both to be computer-executable and to be readable by English speakers without special training. The basic form of LE is syntactic sugar for logic programs, in which all sentences have the same standard form, either as rules of the form conclusion if conditions or as unconditional sentences of the form conclusion. However, LE extends normal logic programming by introducing features that are present in other computer languages and other logics. These features include typed variables signalled by common nouns, and existentially quantified variables in the conclusions of sentences signalled by indefinite articles. Although LE translates naturally into a logic programming language such as Prolog or ASP, it can also serve as a neutral standard, which can be compiled into other lower-level computer languages.

AU  - Braun, Germán

T2  - Journal of Intelligent Information Systems
AB  - Complex system development and maintenance face the challenge of dealing with different types of models due to language affordances, preferences, sizes, and so forth that involve interaction between users with different levels of proficiency. Current conceptual data modelling tools do not fully support these modes of working. It requires that the interaction between multiple models in multiple languages is clearly specified to ensure they keep their intended semantics, which is lacking in extant tools. The key objective is to devise a mechanism to support semantic interoperability in hybrid tools for multi-modal modelling in a plurality of paradigms, all within one system. We propose FaCIL, a framework for such hybrid modelling tools. We design and realise the framework FaCIL, which maps UML, ER and ORM2 into a common metamodel with rules that provide the central point for management among the models and that links to the formalisation and logic-based automated reasoning. FaCIL supports the ability to represent models in different formats while preserving their semantics, and several editing workflows are supported within the framework. It has a clear separation of concerns for typical conceptual modelling activities in an interoperable and extensible way. FaCIL structures and facilitates the interaction between visual and textual conceptual models, their formal specifications, and abstractions as well as tracking and propagating updates across all the representations. FaCIL is compared against the requirements, implemented in crowd 2.0, and assessed with a use case. The proof-of-concept implementation in the web-based modelling tool crowd 2.0 demonstrates its viability. The framework also meets the requirements and fully supports the use case.

TI  - Agile MERODE: a model-driven software engineering method for user-centric and value-based development
AU  - Snoeck, Monique
AU  - Wautelet, Yves
T2  - Software and Systems Modeling
AB  - Agile is often associated with a lack of architectural thinking causing technical debt but has the advantage of user centricity and a strong focus on value. Model-driven software engineering (MDSE) strongly performs for building a quality architecture and code, but lacks focus on user requirements and tends to consider development as a monolithic whole. The combination of Agile and MDSE has been explored, but a convincing integrated method has not been proposed yet. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the specific combination of MERODE—as an example of a proven MDSE method—with Scrum, a reference agile method offering a concrete (sprint-based) life cycle management on the basis of user stories. The method resulting of this integration is called Agile MERODE; it is driven by user stories, themselves associated with behavior-driven development scenarios. It allows for domain-driven design and permits fast development from domain models by means of code generation. An illustrative example further clarifies the practical application of Agile MERODE, while a case study shows the planning game application in the case’s context. While the approach, in its entirety, allows reducing technical debt by building the architecture in a logical, consistent and complete manner, introducing MDSE involves a trade-off with pure value-driven development. Agile MERODE contributes to the state of the art by showing how to increase user centricity in MDSE, how to align model-driven engineering with the Scrum cycle, and how to reduce the technical debt of agile developments yet remaining value-focused.

TI  - Institutional ontology for conceptual modeling
AU  - Eriksson, Owen
AU  - Johannesson, Paul
AU  - Bergholtz, Maria
T2  - Journal of Information Technology
AB  - Conceptual models are intended to capture knowledge about the world. Hence, the design of conceptual models could be informed by theories about what entities exist in the world and how they are constituted. Further, a common assumption within the field of conceptual modeling is that conceptual models and information systems describe entities in the real world, outside the systems. An alternative view is provided by an ontological commitment that recognizes that the institutional world is constructed through language use and the creation of institutional facts. Such an ontological commitment implies that there is an institutional reality, which, to a great extent, is constructed using information infrastructures. Accordingly, conceptual models have not only a descriptive role but also a prescriptive one, meaning that modelers set up a framework of rules that restrict and enable people to construct institutional reality using information infrastructures. Understanding the prescriptive role of conceptual models may revive the area of conceptual modeling in the information systems research community. Reviving conceptual modeling through institutional modeling is motivated by the effect that implemented conceptual models have on information infrastructures and institutions. The purpose of this article is to propose an institutional ontology that can support the design of information infrastructures. The ontology is theoretically informed by institutional theory and a communicative perspective on information systems design, as well as being empirically based on several case studies. It is illustrated using a case study in the welfare sector. A number of guidelines for modeling institutional reality are also proposed.

T2  - Journal of Cloud Computing
AB  - A key challenge in porting enterprise software systems to the cloud is the migration of their database. Choosing a cloud provider and service option (e.g., a database-as-a-service or a manually configured set of virtual machines) typically requires the estimation of the cost and migration duration for each considered option. Many organisations also require this information for budgeting and planning purposes. Existing cloud migration research focuses on the software components, and therefore does not address this need. We introduce a two-stage approach which accurately estimates the migration cost, migration duration and cloud running costs of relational databases. The first stage of our approach obtains workload and structure models of the database to be migrated from database logs and the database schema. The second stage performs a discrete-event simulation using these models to obtain the cost and duration estimates. We implemented software tools that automate both stages of our approach. An extensive evaluation compares the estimates from our approach against results from real-world cloud database migrations.

AB  - Multi-level modeling is currently regaining attention in the database and software engineering community with different emerging proposals and implementations. One driver behind this trend is the need to reduce model complexity, a crucial aspect in a time of analytics in Big Data that deal with complex heterogeneous data structures. So far no standard exists for multi-level modeling. Therefore, different formalization approaches have been proposed to address multi-level modeling and verification in different frameworks and tools. In this article, we present an approach that integrates the formalization, implementation, querying, and verification of multi-level models. The approach has been evaluated in an open-source F-Logic implementation and applied in a large-scale data interoperability project in the oil and gas industry. The outcomes show that the framework is adaptable to industry standards, reduces the complexity of specifications, and supports the verification of standards from a software engineering point of view.

TI  - Formal Model of Business Processes Integrated with Business Rules

T2  - Information Systems Frontiers
AB  - Business Processes describe the ways in which operations are carried out in order to accomplish the intended objectives of organizations. A process can be depicted using a modeling notation, such as Business Process Model and Notation. Process model can also describe operational aspects of every task; but in a properly designed model, the detailed aspects of low-level logic should be delegated to external services, especially to a Business Rule Engine. Business Rules support the specification of knowledge in a declarative manner and can be successfully used for specification of details for process tasks and events. However, there is no unified model of process integrated with rules that ensures data types consistency. Thus, the paper presents a formal description of the integration of Business Processes with Business Rules. We provide a general model for such integration as well as the model applied to a specific rule representation from the Semantic Knowledge Engineering approach.

AB  - The present study was part of a larger surveillance effort to identify the determinants of African honey bee health, and, particularly, to detect honey bee pathogens across Kenya, where 160 colonies were examined from 32 apiaries (five colonies/apiary). From each colony, 20 individual foragers, nurse bees, worker pupae, and drone pupae were sampled separately. These were organized as 30 foragers, 32 nurse bees, 28 worker pupae, and 10 drone pupae pools. Nucleic acid was extracted from the pooled homogenates and tested using a panel of 18 different (RT-)PCR methods targeted at detecting Paenibacillus larvae, Melissococcus plutonius, Ascophaera apis, Aspergillus spp., Nosema ceranae, N. apis, Deformed wing virus (DWV), Varroa destructor virus 1 (VDV 1), Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), Sacbrood virus (SBV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), and Kashmir bee virus. All amplified bands were sequenced and compared to the GenBank database. VDV 1 was the most abundant virus at 50% prevalence in the 100 bee pools. It was closely followed by DWV at 44%. The others were BQCV (36%), SBV (14%), IAPV (9%), ABPV (8%), and N. ceranae (5%). The pathogens co-existed within apiaries. VDV 1 was present in 66% of the apiaries, DWV in 69%, BQCV in 69%, SBV in 28%, IAPV in 22%, ABPV in 19%, and N. ceranae in 13%. The study concludes that these pathogens should be incorporated in honey bee disease surveillance activities in the region.

AB  - India has one of the largest railway networks in the world, it is proposed that some of its lands could be utilized for tree plantation and carbon sequestration activities. In this study, we make an effort to estimate the potential land available for carrying out plantation activities on Indian railways land and further estimate the carbon mitigation potential from these activities. Two land options are considered for plantation activities, (a) Plantations along Railway Tracks (along the route length) and (b) Plantations around railway sidings. The available land along the railway tracks is derived by systematically eliminating the land parcels that are non-suitable using high-resolution satellite data. We eliminated lands that are either already forested or already having tree cover. Uncultivable wastelands (open barren lands) and railway lines passing through water bodies, bridges, railway station platforms, crossings, etc. are also eliminated. Our analysis suggests that a maximum of total potential area of about 56.5 thousand hectares may be available for plantation and other mitigation actions along railway tracks and railway sidings. We used the CO2 fix model for simulating plot level carbon dynamics, the model is simulated for 35 years from 2015 to 2050. The model has been tested and validated for different forest ecosystems across the world in multiple studies. Plot-level simulations are carried out for each Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) as AEZs represent homogenous climatic, ecological, and edaphic units. Plot level mitigation estimates in each of the carbon pools are extrapolated for the available land area and considered for plantation activities in each of the Agro-ecological Zones. This study finds that Indian railways provide a modest mitigation potential (of about 5–25 MtCO2 over 2015–2050, depending on combinations of the area considered for plantations and growth rates), compared to other options available in the Indian landuse change sector such as forest restoration and reclamation of wastelands via tree plantations.

AB  - Large amount of surveillance video data needs effective and interactive methods to record and utilize. Traditional methods mainly focus on low-level analysis of surveillance video data and lack user interaction. Therefore, there is a strong demand of easy-to-use interaction for efficiently analyzing surveillance video information. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale approach merged on the data flow, objects, and frames to achieve visualization of surveillance video data. Combined with the advantage of sketch interaction, the design of multi-scale structure makes the analysis of surveillance content natural and fluent with annotation of video contents. Extensive user studies demonstrate the effectiveness for facilitating users’ interactive visual analysis in surveillance video exploration and significantly reduce playback time to confirm available information.

AB  - Business rules are such requirements that can change very often. As they are formulated by business people (e.g. domain experts) they should be expressed in the way that is—from one side—easy to understood and—from the other—possible for automatic processing. This paper demonstrates a solution to the processing of dynamic business rules which are written in a controlled natural language. A user can add or modify rules during program operation influencing the way the program behaves. The proof-of-concept implementation confirmed that such approach is feasible and can be extended to become mature enough to be introduced in production.

AB  - In this chapter we discuss several applications of rules and rule-based systems. Applications discussed in this chapter are mostly related to the areas of business and software engineering. They relevant for the applications of the semantic knowledge engineering approach. We begin with the discussion of the business rules approach. With time rules systems had to be integrated into other business management systems using business processes. Recently Web-based applications of the Semantic Web project played an important role. A number of past knowledge engineering experiences were placed in a new technological context. However, integration of classic rule-based systems with the Semantic Web technologies is quite challenging. Furthermore, we discuss some common uses of rules in the area of software engineering. A recent emerging computing paradigm of context-aware systems is also an important area for rules. Finally, we take a look at rules as a general programming paradigm.

AB  - In this chapter we discuss original results in the area of Collaborative Knowledge Engineering. The knowledge engineering process becomes more complex when we consider the participation of many individual knowledge engineers. They might participate in the process in roughly the same time using distributed tools. They might also take part in a gradual development of knowledge bases. The most interesting case is the collaborative one where there is a clear mutual engagement of participants in a coordinated effort to solve problems together. This of course requires some special tools. In our opinion they can be provided based on the semantic wiki technology. We begin with the presentation of the Loki platform, an original semantic wiki solution that combines the ideas of SKE with semantic wikis. We extended Loki with business users in mind. To this goal we provided extended capabilities of SBVR authoring. Furthermore, another extension allows for authoring of the BPMN models.

The chapter presents research on the Bank of England/Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) RegTech Sprint initiative, whose objective was to demonstrate how straight-through processing of regulations and regulatory complianceCompliance reporting using semantically enabled applications can be made possible by RegTech. The chapter notes that the full benefits of RegTech will only materialise if the pitfalls of a fragmented Tower of Babel approach are avoided. Semantic standards, we argue, are the key to all this.

AB  - Smart city concept redefines the urban planning and development of the existing and new cities. It drives on economic, social, and environmental sustainability of a city and attracts citizens, professionals, and corporations to build sustainable living. It portrays a city that is operationally optimal and provides a space for innovation. This is achieved through state of the art physical, institutional, and digital infrastructure. This chapter addresses the challenges of the digital aspect of the smart city. Enterprise systems technology is widely used in the organizations and will be utilized in the Smart city systems conceptualization and implementation. Smart city systems definition has been derived by analyzing the smart city requirements. Enterprise systems technology has been explained and the latest ICT trends have been explored to develop the technological foundation of smart city systems. Finally, we introduce partial least square regression, a structural equation modeling method to explore interrelationships between different interdisciplinary constructs and show its application to studying smart city systems. From the digital perspective of smart city, it may be concluded that connectedness leads to integration and integration leads to dynamism and dynamism leads to smartness and cycle continues to realize the best in class smart city.

They are considered to be the first citizens of the requirements world and are the key element of business and technology models. It is highly recommended the rules to be written in a natural language, which is understandable for all interested parties. The paper presents the actual state of a framework for business rules processing. The framework is capable of serving business rules written in a controlled language (which syntax was inspired with SBVR SE) assuming that the source code is properly instrumented. Unfortunately, there exists a very limited number of solutions enabling processing business rules expressed that way. The proof-of-concept implementation proved the correctness and usefulness of the proposed approach.

AB  - The automotive industry has seen a rapid change in the technologies used inside the vehicles. Since the introduction of the first electronic control unit, the impact of electronics and computer science on the quality of the vehicles is increasing every year. Arguably, safety is one of the most important quality attributes of a vehicle that needs special attention during all the stages of the lifecycle of a vehicle. The overall safety of a vehicle can be seen from multiple aspects, such as passive safety, active safety, and functional safety. Functional safety addresses the hazards that are caused by malfunctioning of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems. There are many factors that impact functional safety such as the organization and management, the development process, the design of the systems, the system type and technologies used in it, the quality control methods, etc. The ISO 26262 standard provides the state of the art of functional safety in automotive industry. In this chapter some of the most important aspects of functional safety from ISO 26262 perspective are discussed; namely, safety management, development process, architecture design, and safety assurance are presented here.

AB  - Decision and process descriptions often find themselves encapsulated in long descriptions such as regulations or guidelines. Decision modelling aims at modelling the structure and logic of a decision. For decision modellers, analysing textual documents in search for relevant sentences is a time consuming activity. A promising research topic is to build decision models from text. In this paper, an automatic decision modelling component classifier using deep learning is proposed. Using a large dataset consisting of labeled sentences, the usability of deep learning techniques is investigated. In total three deep learning techniques are evaluated and compared to non-deep learning techniques using both Bag of Words and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. We conclude that classifying decision modelling components is possible and report that BERT for sequence classification is the best performing technique.

AB  - The availability of pertinent, accurate, and useful information has become essential to people and organisations in their collaborations with others. Enterprise architecture provides stakeholder-oriented frameworks and methods supporting producing and consuming information products that satisfy collaborating stakeholders’ concerns. However, while stakeholder analysis suggests identifying relationships between stakeholder and their practices, this has not yet been incorporated in the enterprise architecture standard ISO 42010 and frameworks such as TOGAF. The current lack of support for relationships between stakeholder practices limits analysis and right-sizing of the use of information products in a multi-stakeholder environment, where stakeholders collaborate while having different, possibly divergent, interests, work to be done, goals, and information needs over time. This paper presents a situation viewpoint that can be used to extend stakeholder analysis in enterprise architecture framework with relationships to improve the understanding of why and how information products are used in constellations of stakeholders where each stakeholder plays a role. The situation viewpoint aims to improve the relevance, design, tailoring, effectiveness, evolution, and evaluation of information products such as models.

AB  - Praxeme is an enterprise methodology designed to overcome the difficulties associated with the construction of enterprise information systems. The aspect that specifies the company’s intentions represents the initial phase of the software development process in Praxeme. The use of the eLEL lexicon to express the intentional aspect of Praxeme enables the knowledge in the following aspects to be clarified. However, the logical modeling (logical aspect) from the intentional aspect represented by eLEL is largely lacking in conceptual information to be exploited in the purely IT aspect of Praxeme. In this paper, we propose the use of the ReLEL lexicon to specify the intentional aspect of Praxeme in order to automate the process covering the business and IT aspects of the enterprise. ReLEL is an enterprise terminology database and has precise information concerning the conceptual representation of an information system. For this purpose, we have proposed rules to automate the articulation that covers the intentional, semantic, logical and software aspects of Praxeme. We made use of the ATL and Acceleo language for the implementation of the transformation rules. The result obtained in this article is a SOAP web service of the software aspect of Praxeme.

AB  - The case Rent-A-Car is an exercise in producing the essential model of an enterprise that offers the usufruct of tangible things: Rent-A-Car is a company that rents cars to customers. By applying the OER method to the narrative case description, one acquires the knowledge to produce the essential model of the enterprise. All four aspect models (CM, AM, PM, and FM) are presented. Together they constitute a coherent whole that offers full insight into and overview over the essence of car rental companies. The produced action rules can directly be transformed into executable computer code.

AB  - The first aspect of requirements engineering namely, determining the decisions of interest is considered here. The three kinds of decisions, that is, decisions for formulating policies, policy enforcement rules and operational decisions are identified. Policies are represented in first order logic and an expression in logic is considered as a hierarchy. Each node in the hierarchy gives us a policy formulation decision. Policy enforcement rules are derived from policies by considering the different ways in which policies can be violated. Each violation yields rules from which an appropriate selection of the rules to be adopted must be made. This yields decisions for formulating the rules. Finally, operational decisions are obtained from policy enforcement rules. Computer based support for formulating decisions is outlined.

AB  - Today’s tourism and hospitality managers face new challenges in dealing with travelers who are part of digital natives, brought up in a three-dimensional (3D) world of virtual communication, visual complexity, and online identities. There are plenty of ways hotels can incorporate virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) into the guest experience, and new ones are coming virtually constantly. The current review has demonstrated that virtual hotels could play a significant role in the hospitality and accommodation business. It need not just be considered “a gimmick,” but it also contains “hidden gems” that are important to know in doing future business.

A2  - Nalepa, Grzegorz J.
AB  - Rules are a commonly used and natural way to express knowledge. They have been used for decades in AI, Computer Science, Cognitive Science and other domains. We start by discussing the AI roots of rules and elaborate on different kinds and types of rules. We then focus on a more careful treatment of rules in symbolic AI. There, they constitute an approach which allows for the representation of knowledge and basic automated reasoning. Originally, one of the most important areas for rule applications were expert systems. We will discuss them, along with a much broader perspective. What makes rule-based representation and reasoning particularly interesting is the opportunity for the formalization of rule languages. Therefore, selected logic-based formalizations are considered. We present in more detail a family of so-called attributive logics. Based on these concepts we introduce important requirements for a formalized description of rule based-systems.

AB  - In this chapter we introduce the Semantic Knowledge Engineering approach. It is a development approach for Knowledge-based Systems that uses rule-based knowledge representation. The core of the approach is the formalized rule representation method XTT. The motivation for the approach, along with its distinctive features are given. Then the SKE design process for rule-based systems is presented. SKE was developed to support a heterogeneous architecture of rule-based applications. The approach is well supported by a number of discussed software tools for knowledge base design, generation of the executable rule format, and execution of the rule-based system. Furthermore, tools for rule analysis are discussed.

AB  - In this chapter, we describe the primary steps involved in the conceptual modeling aspects of ontology development. While we give our examples using the family of languages known as description logic (DL), conceptual modeling may be done using other knowledge representation languages. We work primarily in description logic because: (1) the level of expressivity meets most of the requirements of the applications we build; (2) DL language design prioritizes support for efficient, sound, and complete reasoning; and (3) there are a number of open source and commercial tools available. This choice does not imply that DL alone is sufficiently expressive for every application, especially in cases where we need to execute rules or evaluate formulae. Most of the time, however, we can build ontologies in DL and augment them with rules or other logic for application purposes. Because many available tools support convenient checks for logical consistency of ontologies, we can eliminate many of the errors that would otherwise be inconvenient to find in large software and rule-based applications (Nitsche et al., 2014).

AB  - The model-driven development is most promising methodology for cyber-social systems (CSS), cyber-enterprise systems (CES), cyber-physical systems (CPS), and some other types of complex systems. Causality is an important concept in modeling; it helps to reveal the properties of the domain hidden from the outside observer. Great results of CPS engineering based on the perceived causality of specific domain—physical system. The subject domain of the CES as well as of CSS is a complex system type named “an enterprise”. The aim of the article is to enhance a model-based development (MDD) process with a causal modeling approach. The causal modeling aims to reveal the causality inherent to the specific domain type and to represent this deep knowledge on CIM layer. To do this, you need to add a new layer of MDA—a layer of domain knowledge discovery. Traditional MDA/MDD process use the external observation-based domain modeling on CIM layer. Such models assigned to empirical as they based on the notations that do not include causal dependencies, inherent to the domain type. From the causal modeling viewpoint, an enterprise considered to be a self-managed system driven by the internal needs. The specific need creates a particular causal dependence of activities—a management functional dependence (MFD). Concept of the MFD denotes some meaningful collaboration of activities—the causal interactions required by the definite internal need. The first step is conceptualization of the perceived domain causality on CIM layer. A top level conceptual causal model of MFD is defined as a management transaction (MT). The next step is the detailed MT modeling when an elementary control cycle (EMC) is created for each MT. EMC reveals the internal structure of MT and goal-driven interactions between MT internal elements: a workflow of data/knowledge transformations. The results of this study help to better understand that the content of the CIM layer should be aligned with the domain causality as close as reasonable. The main contribution is the extended MDA scheme with a new layer of the domain knowledge discovery and the causal knowledge discovery (CKD) technique tailored for enterprise domain. Technique uses twofold decomposition of management transaction: a control view-based and self-managing view based. The outcome of technique is hierarchy of management transactions and their internal components: lower level management functions and processes, goals, knowledge and information flows. Causal knowledge discovery technique is illustrated using the study programme renewal domain.

AB  - Logic programs and imperative programs employ different notions of computing. Logic programs compute by proving that a goal is a logical consequence of the program, or by showing that the goal is true in a model defined by the program. Imperative programs compute by starting from an initial state, executing actions to transition from one state to the next, and terminating (if at all) in a final state when the goal is solved.

T2  - Smart Digital Service Ecosystems: A Research Roadmap from Service Computing and Engineering Perspectives
A2  - Badr, Youakim
AB  - The challenges related to designing IT-enabled services revolve around key concepts, such service concept, service process, and service systems. From computational perspective, IT-enabled services rely on Web services and relationships between software components (i.e., collaboration, substitution, inheritance, etc.). These relationships lead to rethink Web services selection and discovery based on dependencies between them, and redesign Web service compositions to cope with changes in service processes. Within the context of service reference and requirement models and collaborative processes driven by business artifacts, this chapter introduces the digital service ecosystem and its underlying computational infrastructure. Moreover, ad hoc and rule-driven composition algorithms are also discussed. The composition rules express multiple constraints on the control flow of Web service execution (e.g., structure rules), impose dependencies among Web services, and set constraints on their nonfunctional properties. This chapter presents a new approach to Web service discovery that considers implicit social-like relationships between Web services and end-to-end Web service selection framework, considering quantitative or qualitative nonfunctional properties.

The existing technology is constrained by extremely limited capabilities in processing large volumes of unstructured data and automating decision making beyond rule engines. Therefore, AI can help to complete the automation of a business process and build a machine interface for customers, partners, and employees.

T2  - Modeling with Rules Using Semantic Knowledge Engineering
A2  - Nalepa, Grzegorz J.
AB  - Designing a knowledge base for a RBS is a tedious task. The main issue concerns the identification of system properties on which the rules are based. This is an iterative process that needs proper support. This stage is often generally referred to as the conceptual design. The focus of the ARD+ method presented in this chapter is the initial transition from user-provided specification (often in natural language) that includes general concepts, to the rule specification that tie rules with these concepts. Moreover, the semi-automated prototyping of the structure of the knowledge bases is possible. The schemas of XTT decision tables can be obtained, along with default inference links between tables. We introduce the main intuitions behind the ARD+ method and its formalization. Then an algorithm for prototyping the structure of the XTT rule base is given. The design with ARD+ can be also used to generate a business process with rules.
