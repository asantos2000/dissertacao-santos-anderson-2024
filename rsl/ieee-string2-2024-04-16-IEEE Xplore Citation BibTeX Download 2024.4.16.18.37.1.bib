  abstract={GRC and IT-GRC are currently playing an essential role and receiving a lot of attention. GRC has a role to help companies ensure the attainment of business goals and prevent losses that can cause company losses. This research was conducted to carry out a bibliometric analysis and literature review on GRC and IT-GRC to determine research trends and topics, as well as the current information technology discussed in available research on GRC. In this research, we propose a future GRC research agenda that is related to research topics, industries that need to be supported, and what modern information technology can be used to encourage the successful implementation of GRC, to increase the role of GRC in increasing company resilience in facing turbulence, increasing business, and helping companies in achieving sustainable growth.},

  abstract={A growing number of information privacy breaches resulting in financial and reputational damage to organizations as well as individuals' anxiety regarding the misuse of one's personal information emphasize the need for a rigid organizational information privacy initiative. An interesting proposition is the integration of organizational information privacy protection in a Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) context. GRC is a novel and multifaceted means to an approach, whereby risk and compliance are regarded as strategic initiatives that link to the business objectives. This in turn requires corporate governance to foster the growth and performance of the organization. This paper proposes a structural and navigational method for integrated organizational information privacy protection. This is done by means of using a conceptual framework that was previously constructed by incorporating identified information privacy protection elements within an existing GRC frame of reference. This paper seeks to update the conceptual framework that was initially constructed for information privacy protection to organizational information privacy protection. The focus of this paper is how accountable organizations should protect the personal information of individual's and the framework is therefore adapted to organizational information privacy protection. The objective of this paper is to use the process component of the updated conceptual framework to construct a structural and navigational method for organizational information privacy protection.},

  abstract={Innovation in Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to produce a wealth of techniques, mostly coming from the inductive form of AI also known as Machine Learning (ML). The majority of ML algorithms is industry-neutral and business process agnostic. ML innovation is propelled by publicly available research, which gets harvested into Open Source for wide distribution through software and Cloud vendors.Ongoing AI technology work creates an immense source of assets for data-driven modeling, delivered as software libraries. However, the application of these assets for data monetization in finance does not happen with nearly comparable success or speed. The latter challenge is commonly known as the "scalability problem of AI". As new techniques continue to grow vigorously, the investment from large finance institutions to cost-effectively produce applications for a variety of lines-of-business (LoBs) and business processes will increase. The availability of ML capabilities on Public Cloud is a way for enterprises to increase productivity by benefiting from the best AI assets available from providers and startups. But data is constrained in terms of location, access and use in most finance competences by either laws or internal Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) rules. Legal limitations include, and go beyond, Privacy Acts, impacting non-retail processes where AI techniques must be explained in layperson language to decision-makers and regulators before field deployment. The latter is not yet achieved satisfactorily. Lastly, a large percentage of AI projects fail, in part due to unsuitable ML modeling for analytics and forecasting problems in finance. The variety and complexity of human behavior present in most finance processes calls for understanding AI at a level of cognitive depth that has no precedent in other industries. It is imperative that AI be approached so that finance competence and functional specificity are embedded a-priori into ML techniques and not as use-case afterthoughts. For acceleration of AI assessments, it is critical that ML techniques available in software implement models readily aligned to finance problems.This paper presents an approach to building an Architecture for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Finance by focusing on analytics and forecasting for business-to-business operations. This AI Architecture hinges on three axes and their interplay: Design Dimensions, Modeling Building-Blocks and Work-Practice. The goal is to support finance practitioners navigate the plethora of AI options more effectively and accelerate data monetization. While ML techniques in data analytics and forecasting apply to many scenarios, this paper focuses on selected competences in Banking, Financial Markets and Chief Finance Officer (CFO) operations.The architecture and method introduced in this paper is a first step toward a service practice. We harvest from our work carried out in banks, asset management firms and CFO lines-of-business as well as R&D experiences in new finance technologies for over one decade. As with any other architecture and deployment methodology, this work requires further harvesting, more information technology tools and sharing experiences across practitioners. It is hoped that finance organizations could adopt these new capabilities in their own Centers of Excellence or other internal organizations leading data-driven transformation and monetization across the firm.},

  abstract={Financial markets are difficult to predict due to its complex systems dynamics. Although there have been some recent studies that use machine learning techniques for financial markets prediction, they do not offer satisfactory performance on financial returns. We propose a novel one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN) model to predict financial market movement. The customized one-dimensional convolutional layers scan financial trading data through time, while different types of data, such as prices and volume, share parameters (kernels) with each other. Our model automatically extracts features instead of using traditional technical indicators and thus can avoid biases caused by selection of technical indicators and pre-defined coefficients in technical indicators. We evaluate the performance of our prediction model with strictly backtesting on historical trading data of six futures from January 2010 to October 2017. The experiment results show that our CNN model can effectively extract more generalized and informative features than traditional technical indicators, and achieves more robust and profitable financial performance than previous machine learning approaches.},
