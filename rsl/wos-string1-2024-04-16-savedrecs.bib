Abstract = {Public procurement is viewed as a major market force that can be used to
   promote innovation and drive small and medium-sized enterprises growth.
   In such cases, procurement system design relies on intermediates that
   provide vertical linkages between suppliers and providers of innovative
   services and products. In this work we propose an innovative methodology
   for decision support in the process of supplier discovery, which
   precedes the final supplier selection. We focus on data gathered from
   community-based sources such as Reddit and Wikidata and avoid any use of
   historical open procurement datasets to identify small and medium sized
   suppliers of innovative products and services that own very little
   market shares. We look into a real-world procurement case study from the
   financial sector focusing on the Financial and Market Data offering and
   develop an interactive web-based support tool to address certain
   requirements of the Italian central bank. We demonstrate how a suitable
   selection of natural language processing models, such as a
   part-of-speech tagger and a word-embedding model, in combination with a
   novel named-entity-disambiguation algorithm, can efficiently analyze
   huge quantity of textual data, increasing the probability of a full
   coverage of the market.},

Abstract = {In the last years, Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning have
   matured from a facinating research area to real-word applications across
   multiple domains. Enterprises adopt data-driven approaches for various
   use cases. With the increased adoption, such issues as governance of the
   models, deployment, scalability, reusablity and maintenance are widely
   addressed on the engineering side, but not so much on the knowledge
   side. In this paper, we demonstrate 10 ways of leveraging ontology for
   Natural Language Processing. Specifically, we explore the usage of
   ontologies and related standards for labeling schema, configuration,
   providing lexical data, powering rule engine and automated generation of
   rules, as well as providing a standard output format. Additionally, we
   discuss three NLP-based applications: semantic search, question
   answering and natural language querying and show how they can benefit
   from ontology usage. The paper summarizes our experience of using
   ontology in a number of projects for medical, enterprise, financial,
   legal and security domains.},

Abstract = {The FinSim-2 is a second edition of FinSim Shared Task on Learning
   Semantic Similarities for the Financial Domain, colocated with the
   FinWeb workshop. FinSim-2 proposed the challenge to automatically learn
   effective and precise semantic models for the financial domain. The
   second edition of the FinSim offered an enriched dataset in terms of
   volume and quality, and interested in systems which make creative use of
   relevant resources such as ontologies and lexica, as well as systems
   which make use of contextual word embeddings such as BERT{[}4]. Going
   beyond the mere representation of words is a key step to industrial
   applications that make use of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This is
   typically addressed using either unsupervised corpus-derived
   representations like word embeddings, which are typically opaque to
   human understanding but very useful in NLP applications or manually
   created resources such as taxonomies and ontologies, which typically
   have low coverage and contain inconsistencies, but provide a deeper
   understanding of the target domain. Finsim is inspired from previous
   endeavours in the Semeval community, which organized several
   competitions on semantic/lexical relation extraction between
   concepts/words. This year, 18 system runs were submitted by 7 teams and
   systems were ranked according to 2 metrics, Accuracy and Mean rank. All
   the systems beat our baseline 1 model by over 15 points and the best
   systems beat the baseline 2 by over 1 similar to 3 points in accuracy.},

Title = {An ontological artifact for classifying social media: Text mining
   analysis for financial data},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this paper we utilize a structured natural language processing
   implementation of the Financial Industry Business Ontology (HBO) to
   extract financial information from the unstructured textual data of the
   social media platform Twitter regarding financial and budget information
   in the public sector, namely the two public-private agencies of the Port
   Authority of NY and NJ (PANYNJ), and the NY Metropolitan Transportation
   Agency (MTA). This research initiative uses the Design Science Research
   (DSR) perspective to develop an artifact to classify tweets as being
   either relevant to financial bonds or not. We apply a frame and slot
   approach from the artificial intelligence and natural language
   processing literature to operationalize this artifact. FIBO provides
   standards for defining the facts, terms, and relationships associated
   with financial concepts. We show that FIBO grammar can be used to mine
   semantic meaning from unstructured textual data and that it provides a
   nuanced representation of structured financial data. With this artifact,
   social media such as Twitter may be accessed for the knowledge that its
   text contains about financial concepts using the FIBO ontology. This
   process is anticipated to be of interest to bond issuers, regulators,
   analysts, investors, and academics. It may also be extended towards
   other financial domains such as securities, derivatives, commodities,
   and banking that relate to FIBO ontologies, as well as more generally to
   develop a structured knowledge representation of unstructured data
   through the application of an ontology. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Natural language processing in specific domains such as financial
   markets requires the knowledge of domain ontology. Therefore, developing
   a domain-specific lexicon to improve financial context sentiment
   analysis is noteworthy. In this paper, by exploring a wide related
   corpus along with using lexical resources, a hybrid approach is proposed
   to build a lexicon specialized for financial markets sentiment analysis.
   The lexicon is applied on a large dataset gathered from Twitter during
   nine months. Experimental results demonstrate a significant correlation
   between extracted sentiments from the corpus and market trends which
   indicates lexicon's superior efficiency in measuring market sentiment
   compared with general-purpose dictionaries.},

Abstract = {Data normalization methodologies are extremely welcome to link extracted
   information from textual data to different semantic resources. These
   methodologies have been previously well researched especially in the
   biomedical domain, where health concepts were normalized and described
   using semantic tags. Recently, a methodology for normalizing food
   concepts has been proposed, based on Named-Entity Recognition methods
   resulting in the FoodOntoMap semantic resource. In this paper, we
   propose and evaluate a new architecture for linking phrases (i.e.
   textual name for foods) to concepts from semantic resources in the Food
   and Nutrition domain. We represent the food phrases (i.e. their textual
   name) in continuous vector space using state-of-the-art Natural Language
   Processing (NLP) embedding algorithms, and evaluate their proximity with
   respect to the annotated semantic food concepts. Additionally, indexing
   was incorporated to improve efficiency.
   The GloVe embedding with mean pooling provided best evaluation results,
   with maximum recall of 74\% for the Snomed CT semantic dataset, which is
   promising result, but also opens a space for future improvement of the
   phrase representations, and their incorporation in this system.},

Title = {Extraction of Formal Manufacturing Rules from Unstructured English Text},
Journal = {COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {134},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Semantics-based approaches - founded on the idea of explicitly encoding
   meaning separately from the data or the application code - are being
   applied to manufacturing, for example, to enable early manufacturability
   feedback. These approaches rely on formal, i.e., computer-interpretable,
   knowledge and rules along with the context or semantics, which
   facilitates the reuse and sharing of the knowledge via semantic web
   technologies. On the other hand, manufacturing knowledge has been
   maintained primarily in the form of unstructured English text. It is
   considered impractical for engineers to author accurate, formal, and
   structured manufacturing rules. However, previous efforts on extracting
   semantics from unstructured text in manufacturing have mainly focused on
   basic concept names and hierarchies for ontology creation, rather than
   extracting complex manufacturing rules. In this context, this paper
   focuses on the development of a semantics-based framework for acquiring
   formal manufacturing rules from English text, such as those written in
   manufacturing handbooks, by guiding standard Natural Language Processing
   (NLP) techniques with formal manufacturing knowledge (i.e., controlled
   vocabulary and domain ontology). Specifically, this paper studies the
   problem of rule extraction in the manufacturing domain, proposes the
   formal rule extraction framework, and demonstrates its feasibility. From
   the dataset of 133 sentences with a manufacturing rule, the proposed
   framework was able to extract correct rules from approximately 57\% of
   the sentences. This paper also demonstrates the extensibility of the
   framework. Specifically, the framework was initially developed using the
   three sections of a manufacturing handbook, including milling, metal
   stamping, and die-casting sections, and could be successfully applied to
   the rest of the book after just updating the formal manufacturing
   knowledge to cover the other sections. This paper provides meaningful
   results in terms of formalization, thus will contribute to the
   development, sharing, and reuse of formal manufacturing knowledge that
   includes complex manufacturing rules. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The massive amount and multi-sourced, multi-structured data in the
   upstream petroleum industry impose great challenge on data integration
   and smart application. Knowledge graph, as an emerging technology, can
   potentially provide a way to tackle the challenges associated with oil
   and gas big data. This paper proposes an engineering-based method that
   can improve upon traditional natural language processing to construct
   the domain knowledge graph based on a petroleum exploration and
   development ontology. The exploration and development knowledge graph is
   constructed by assembling Sinopec's multi-sourced heterogeneous
   database, and millions of nodes. The two applications based on the
   constructed knowledge graph are developed and validated for
   effectiveness and advantages in providing better knowledge services for
   the oil and gas industry. \& COPY; 2022 China University of Geosciences

Abstract = {Manufacturing knowledge is maintained primarily in the unstructured text
   in industry. To facilitate the reuse of the knowledge, previous efforts
   have utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify
   manufacturing documents or to extract structured knowledge (e.g.
   ontology) from manufacturing text. On the other hand, extracting more
   complex knowledge, such as manufacturing rule, has not been feasible in
   a practical scenario, as standard NLP techniques cannot address the
   input text that needs validation. Specifically, if the input text
   contains the information irrelevant to the rule-definition or
   semantically invalid expression, standard NLP techniques cannot
   selectively derive precise information for the extraction of the desired
   formal manufacturing rule. To address the gap, we developed the feedback
   generation method based on Constraint-based Modeling (CBM) coupled with
   NLP and domain ontology, designed to support formal manufacturing rule
   extraction. Specifically, the developed method identifies the necessity
   of input text validation based on the predefined constraints and
   provides the relevant feedback to help the user modify the input text,
   so that the desired rule can be extracted. We proved the feasibility of
   the method by extending the previously implemented formal rule
   extraction framework. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by
   enabling the extraction of correct manufacturing rules from all the
   cases that need input text validation, about 30\% of the dataset, after
   modifying the input text based on the feedback. We expect the feedback
   generation method will contribute to the adoption of semantics-based
   technology in the manufacturing field, by facilitating precise knowledge
   acquisition from manufacturing-related documents in a practical
   scenario.},

Title = {Multi-ontology embeddings approach on human-aligned multi-ontologies
   representation for gene-disease associations prediction},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objectives: Knowledge graphs and ontologies in the biomedical domain
   provide rich contextual knowledge for a variety of challenges. Employing
   that for knowledge-driven NLP tasks such as gene-disease association
   prediction represents a promising way to increase the predictive power
   of a model.Methods: We investigated the power of infusing the embedding
   of two aligned ontologies as prior knowledge to the NLP models. We
   evaluated the performance of different models on some largescale
   gene-disease association datasets and compared it with a model without
   incorporating contextualized knowledge (BERT).Results: The experiments
   demonstrated that the knowledge-infused model slightly outperforms BERT
   by creating a small number of bridges. Thus, indicating that
   incorporating cross-references across ontologies can enhance the
   performance of base models without the need for more complex and costly
   training. However, further research is needed to explore the
   generalizability of the model. We expected that adding more bridges
   would bring further improvement based on the trend we observed in the
   experiments. In addition, the use of state-of-the-art knowledge graph
   embedding methods on a joint graph from connecting OGG and DOID with
   bridges also yielded promising results.Conclusion: Our work shows that
   allowing language models to leverage structured knowledge from
   ontologies does come with clear advantages in the performance. Besides,
   the annotation stage brought out in this paper is constrained in
   reasonable complexity.},

   financial relations and a description of our ongoing research towards
   building one based on unstructured data. First, we aim to create a

   plan to harness Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to extract
   financial relations from text sources such as news, press releases, etc.
   and to organize the derived information according to our crafted
   ontology. In addition to an overview of the literature in these areas,
   we describe our vision of an automated knowledge system for the experts

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel interpreting framework that learns
   an interpretable model based on an ontology-based sampling technique to
   explain agnostic prediction models. Different from existing approaches,
   our algorithm considers contextual correlation among words, described in
   domain knowledge ontologies, to generate semantic explanations. To
   narrow down the search space for explanations, which is a major problem
   of long and complicated text data, we design a learnable anchor
   algorithm, to better extract explanations locally. A set of regulations
   is further introduced, regarding combining learned interpretable
   representations with anchors to generate comprehensible semantic
   explanations. An extensive experiment conducted on two real-world
   datasets shows that our approach generates more precise and insightful
   explanations compared with baseline approaches.},

Abstract = {In the last few years, online social media networks have witnessed an
   amazing growth in their worldwide usage, with millions of users
   constantly publishing messages containing opinions on virtually any
   imaginable topic, including opinions about companies. Accurately
   understanding these opinions could provide an almost real-time overview
   of how the company and its actions are perceived by the general public.
   While existing approaches used for analyzing the opinions expressed in
   social media messages commonly limit themselves in discovering the
   polarity of the messages, expressed as a positive, negative, or neutral
   value, in the present paper, we use semantic web technologies and
   natural language processing in order to uncover actual feelings, such as
   happiness, surprise, or disappointment. The emotions are structured in a
   hierarchy using an ontology, thus offering the possibility to analyze
   the overall opinion regarding the company at different levels of
   granularity. The proposed approach is validated by performing an
   analysis of the public perception towards four well-known technology
   companies.},

Title = {Ontology-Based Ambiguity Resolution of Manufacturing Text for Formal

Abstract = {Manufacturing companies maintain manufacturing knowledge primarily as
   unstructured text. To facilitate formal use of such knowledge, previous
   efforts have utilized natural language processing (NLP) to classify
   manufacturing documents or extract manufacturing concepts/relations.
   However, extracting more complex knowledge, such as manufacturing rules,
   has been evasive due to the lack of methods to resolve ambiguities.
   Specifically, standard NLP techniques do not address domain-specific
   ambiguities that are due to manufacturing-specific meanings implicit in
   the text. To address this important gap, we propose an ambiguity
   resolution method that utilizes domain ontology as the mechanism to
   incorporate the domain context. We demonstrate its feasibility by
   extending our previously implemented manufacturing rule extraction
   framework. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by resolving
   all the domain-specific ambiguities in the dataset and an improvement in
   correct detection of rules to 70\% (increased by about 13\%). We expect
   that this work will contribute to the adoption of semantics-based
   technology in manufacturing field, by enabling the extraction of precise
   formal knowledge from text.},

Title = {Automated multimodal sensemaking: Ontology-based integration of
   linguistic frames and visual data},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Frame evocation from visual data is an essential process for multimodal
   sensemaking, due to the multimodal abstraction provided by frame
   semantics. However, there is a scarcity of data-driven approaches and
   tools to automate it. We propose a novel approach for explainable
   automated multimodal sensemaking by linking linguistic frames to their
   physical visual occurrences, using ontology-based knowledge engineering
   techniques. We pair the evocation of linguistic frames from text to
   visual data as ``framal visual manifestations{''}. We present a deep
   ontological analysis of the implicit data model of the Visual Genome
   image dataset, and its formalization in the novel Visual Sense Ontology
   (VSO). To enhance the multimodal data from this dataset, we introduce a
   framal knowledge expansion pipeline that extracts and connects
   linguistic frames - including values and emotions - to images, using
   multiple linguistic resources for disambiguation. It then introduces the
   Visual Sense Knowledge Graph (VSKG), a novel resource. VSKG is a
   queryable knowledge graph that enhances the accessibility and
   comprehensibility of Visual Genome's multimodal data, based on SPARQL
   queries. VSKG includes frame visual evocation data, enabling more
   advanced forms of explicit reasoning, analysis and sensemaking. Our work
   represents a significant advancement in the automation of frame
   evocation and multimodal sense-making, performed in a fully
   interpretable and transparent way, with potential applications in
   various fields, including the fields of knowledge representation,
   computer vision, and natural language processing.},

Abstract = {This article explores how natural language processing techniques can be
   applied to extract information from spatial planning documents and how
   this information can be represented in a knowledge graph. The proposed
   method uses named entity recognition to extract relevant information
   from text and structure it into labels and corresponding values. The
   extracted information is represented in the form of a knowledge graph,
   which allows for better understanding and management of complex
   relationships between different elements in spatial planning documents.
   For this purpose, a dedicated ontology was developed. The research
   demonstrates that the proposed method achieves good results with high
   precision, recall, and F1 scores for all entity types, with particularly
   remarkable results for biologically active area predictions. The
   practical application of this method in spatial planning can contribute
   to improving decision-making processes and streamlined collaboration
   between different entities involved in spatial planning.},

Title = {A Semantic Annotation Pipeline towards the Generation of Knowledge
   Graphs in Tribology},
Journal = {LUBRICANTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Within the domain of tribology, enterprises and research institutions
   are constantly working on new concepts, materials, lubricants, or
   surface technologies for a wide range of applications. This is also
   reflected in the continuously growing number of publications, which in
   turn serve as guidance and benchmark for researchers and developers. Due
   to the lack of suited data and knowledge bases, knowledge acquisition
   and aggregation is still a manual process involving the time-consuming
   review of literature. Therefore, semantic annotation and natural
   language processing (NLP) techniques can decrease this manual effort by
   providing a semi-automatic support in knowledge acquisition. The
   generation of knowledge graphs as a structured information format from
   textual sources promises improved reuse and retrieval of information
   acquired from scientific literature. Motivated by this, the contribution
   introduces a novel semantic annotation pipeline for generating knowledge
   in the domain of tribology. The pipeline is built on Bidirectional
   Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-a state-of-the-art
   language model-and involves classic NLP tasks like information
   extraction, named entity recognition and question answering. Within this
   contribution, the three modules of the pipeline for document extraction,
   annotation, and analysis are introduced. Based on a comparison with a
   manual annotation of publications on tribological model testing,
   satisfactory performance is verified.},

Title = {Knowledge-informed semantic alignment and rule interpretation for
   automated compliance checking},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As an essential prodecure to improve design quality in the construction
   industry, automated rule checking (ARC) requires intelligent rule
   interpretation from regulatory texts and precise alignment of concepts
   from different sources. However, there still exists semantic gaps
   between design models and regulatory texts, hindering the exploitation
   of ARC. Thus, a knowledge-informed framework for improved ARC is
   proposed based on natural language processing. Within the framework, an
   ontology is first established to represent domain knowledge, including
   concepts, synonyms, relationships, constraints, etc. Then, semantic
   alignment and conflict resolution are introduced to enhance the rule
   interpretation process based on predefined domain knowledge and
   unsu-pervised learning techniques. Finally, an algorithm is developed to
   identify the proper SPARQL function for each rule, and then to generate
   SPARQL-based queries for model checking purposes, thereby making it
   possible to interpret complex rules where extra implicit data needs to
   be inferred. Experiments show that the proposed framework and methods
   successfully filled the semantic gaps between design models and
   regulatory texts with domain knowledge, which achieves a 90.1\% accuracy
   and substantially outperforms the commonly used keyword matching method.
   In addition, the proposed rule interpretation method proves to be 5
   times faster than the manual interpretation by domain experts. This
   research contributes to the body of knowledge of a novel framework and
   the corresponding methods to enhance automated rule checking with domain
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {Natural language processing still faces the challenge of getting
   machines to understand the meaning expressed by words that occur in a
   sentence. Semantic annotation helps in this process by adding metadata
   that attaches meaning to lexemes. There are several semantic aspects
   that can be annotated, such as function, semantic role and ontological
   categories. Top-level ontological categories add information about the
   nature of the concept denoted by the lexeme and allow eliminating
   ambiguities. The proposed work is a hybrid semantic annotation approach
   based on top-level ontologies applied to an American English Corpus. The
   research is divided into two annotation steps, both using the top-level
   categories of Schema.org as annotation labels. In the first step a
   rules-based annotator is created, and in the second step a manual
   annotation is made for correction and addition of labels in the corpus
   annotated by rule annotator. The contribution of this work is the
   generation of an annotated corpus that can be used in the training of
   automatic annotators.},

Abstract = {Text normalisation is an important task in the context of Natural
   Language Processing. By normalisation, free text is mapped into
   dictionaries, i.e. indexed collections of locutions recognised as
   typical of a particular jaergon. In general, technical dictionaries are
   difficult to build and validate. They are typically constructed by hand
   on the basis of everyday human work and they are agreement-based. This
   is indubitably time consuming and the approach requires a strong human
   supervision and does not provide a general methodology. In this paper,
   we perform the first steps towards the to automatic building of a
   dictionary for Italian journalistic lexicon, called NewsDict, based on
   sub dictionaries able to characterise main topics occurring in newspaper
   articles. We exploit a dataset of annotated documents from some Italian
   newspapers and a statistical techniques based on the Mutual Information
   Principle. Documents contains information such as the release date and
   the topic of the article and has been directly annotated by the author.
   To check the accuracy of the dictionary we built, we develop an initial
   test. We normalise a control set of journal article into NewsDict.
   Crossing results presented in this paper against the human annotation,
   we provide a fist measure of performances of the described methodology.},

Abstract = {The current paper focuses on a framework for structuring large document
   stores with the help of intelligent metadata. The described landscape
   includes a proprietary knowledge graph which ingests millions of
   concepts from external, third-party data providers and accommodates
   internal class taxonomies; an NLP service for automated annotation of
   textual data; an annotations quality control mechanism; tools for
   knowledge graph ontology and concept management; and an extensive API
   layer. The authors present an approach they have tested and proved
   successful in one of the leading media companies in the world, whose
   media content is a core data asset. The proposed solutions enable
   content analytics in their proper context and allow explicit and
   implicit connections between the content and other company data - i.e.,
   user (media content consumer) data. The latter empowers the efficient
   application of advanced analytical models for searches and
   recommendations and the implementation of accurate data-driven virtual
   assistants.The paper advises addressing the metadata quality concerns,
   which the authors' extensive practice identifies as an essential
   prerequisite for applied analytics delivering significant business
   value.},

Title = {An adaptable, high-performance relation extraction system for complex
   sentences},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {251},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {The rapid proliferation of text data has lead to an increase in the use
   of Information Extraction (IE) techniques to automatically extract key
   information in a fast and effective manner. Relation Extraction (RE), a
   sub-task of IE focuses on extracting semantic relations from free
   natural language text and is crucial for further applications including
   Question Answering, Information Retrieval, Knowledge Base construction,
   Text Summarization, etc. Literature shows that supervised learning
   approaches were widely used in RE. However, the performance of
   supervised methodologies depend on the availability of domain-specific
   annotated datasets which is not viable for many of the domains including
   legal, financial, insurance etc. In recent times, Open Information
   Extraction (OIE) techniques address this issue, by facilitating
   domain-independent extraction of relations from large text corpora with
   no demand for domain-specific tagged data and predefined relation
   classes. Even though OIE systems are fast and simple to implement, they
   are less effective in handling complex sentences, and often produce
   redundant extractions. This paper proposes an efficient RE system to
   extract domain-specific relations from natural language text, consisting
   of Knowledge-based and Semi-supervised learning systems, integrated with
   domain ontology. We evaluated the performance of proposed work on
   `judicial domain `` as a use case and found that it overcomes the flaws
   and limitations of existing RE approaches, by achieving better results
   in terms of precision and recall. On further analysis, we found that the
   proposed system outperforms existing cutting-edge OIE systems on varying
   sentence length and complexity. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {We have developed, in collaboration with medical and computer experts,
   the ontology-based Medical Report Mapping Process to support the
   transformation of unstructured reports into a structured representation.
   Nevertheless, the techniques employed in this two-phase process must be
   performed individually and manually by computer instructions, which
   hinder their use by users not familiar with such language. Thereby, this
   work proposes a tool to automate and optimize this process by
   integrating its techniques in a computational system, which was built
   using a software engineering prototyping approach. This system was
   experimentally evaluated by applying it to a set of 100 textual reports.
   The first phase decreased the total number of phrases (853) and words
   (2520) by 82.25\% (48) and 92.70\% (184), respectively. In the second
   phase, 100\% of the relevant pieces of information (previously
   established) present in the reports were transcribed. Also, the second
   phase was applied, using the same configuration as the first study, in
   another set with 250 textual reports, resulting in a mapping rate of
   99.74\%. The unprocessed and unmapped words, regarding both experimental
   evaluations, were recorded for later inclusion into the ontology. By
   using this system, efficient and scalable investigations can be
   performed from medical reports, contributing to generate new knowledge.
   Also, the system facilitates the definition of these structures due to
   the feasibility to analyze different sentences in unique phrase sets.

Abstract = {In the context of the rapid development of big data and artificial
   intelligence, knowledge service theory and big data technology are
   applied to build a smart port supply chain knowledge service model. This
   model provides a personalized, intelligent, and diversified
   knowledge-based service system platform solution to port supply chain
   enterprises, helping to realize port supply chain transformation and
   upgrading and intelligent integrated operations. This paper analyses and
   summarizes the research status on knowledge service demand and port
   supply chain knowledge service during the development and operation of
   the port supply chain and applies big data and artificial intelligence
   technologies such as knowledge matching, knowledge fusion, and natural
   language processing. A port supply chain knowledge service model
   including knowledge acquisition, knowledge organization and knowledge
   service modules is constructed. The ontology method is used to construct
   the ontology knowledge base of the port supply chain, and based on this,
   computational reasoning experiments are performed. The experiments show
   that ontology technology demonstrates effectiveness and superiority in
   constructing a knowledge service system model for the port supply chain
   in terms of knowledge representation and knowledge reasoning.},

Abstract = {With the ever-increasing number of social media messages posted daily,
   millions of users express opinions on various subjects, including
   opinions concerning the characteristics of products and services that
   they have already bought or they intend to buy in the near future.
   Accurately knowing the opinions of such a large number of users in near
   real time would be invaluable for the companies marketing those
   products. Thus, in the present paper, we propose an approach based on
   Semantic Web technologies, natural language processing and machine
   learning for accurately analysing the social media messages posted on
   Twitter. Compared to existing approaches, which mainly focus on
   determining the opinion of the user concerning the entire product, the
   approach proposed in the present paper offers deeper insights, by taking
   into consideration the fact that a user might have different and
   sometimes even contradictory opinions concerning the various
   characteristics of a single product. We start by creating an ontology
   for representing the relationships between the products and their
   characteristics, ontology that is also used for performing named entity
   recognition, given the fact that various users can employ different
   terms for referring to the same concept. The ontology is afterwards used
   in order to filter from the huge number of tweets published every minute
   only the ones that can prove relevant for the analysis. In the next
   step, aspect-based sentiment analysis is employed in order to determine
   the sentiment expressed by the social media user regarding one or
   several characteristics of the analysed product. The results of the
   analysis are stored as semantically structured data, thus making it
   possible to fully exploit the possibilities offered by Semantic Web
   technologies, such as inference and accessing the vast knowledge in
   Linked Open Data, for further analysis.},

Abstract = {With the rapid adoption of web services, the need to protect against
   various threats has become imperative for organizations operating in
   cyberspace. Organizations are increasingly opting to get financial cover
   in the event of losses due to a security incident. This helps them
   safeguard against the threat posed to third-party services that the
   organization uses. It is in the organization's interest to understand
   the insurance requirements and procure all necessary direct and
   liability coverages. This helps transfer some risks to the insurance
   providers. However, cyber insurance policies often list details about
   coverages and exclusions using legalese that can be difficult to
   comprehend. Currently, it takes a significant manual effort to parse and
   extract knowledgeable rules from these lengthy and complicated policy
   documents. We have developed a semantically rich machine processable
   framework to automatically analyze cyber insurance policy and populate a
   knowledge graph that efficiently captures various inclusion and
   exclusion terms and rules embedded in the policy. In this paper, we
   describe this framework that has been built using technologies from AI,
   including Semantic Web, Modal/ Deontic Logic, and Natural Language
   Processing. We have validated our approach using industry standards
   proposed by the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and
   applying it against publicly available policies of 7 cyber insurance
   vendors. Our system will enable cyber insurance seekers to automatically
   analyze various policy documents and make a well-informed decision by
   identifying its inclusions and exclusions.},

Abstract = {Comma Separated Value (CSV) files are widely used as a fundamental data
   format. Due to its simple structure and ease of creation, many of the
   data files that are published in open source and used by organizations
   are usually stored in CSV files. However, searching for or retrieving
   expected data from CSV files is quite limited by the traditional
   keyword-matching technique which can't specify the conditions for
   searching or processing any data on the search. This paper presents a
   new model that will allow users to easily retrieve information from CSV
   files by natural language, a language that users are familiar with and
   use in everyday life. Users can specify conditions for data retrieval
   and processing to create the information they need. This will help
   non-technician users easily retrieve information without the need to
   learn any additional computer languages or programs. The research data
   includes natural language messages collected from various sources, both
   online and offline, to cover on both formal and semi-formal language
   level. By using natural language processing and techniques such as
   semantic patterns, ontology, and interactive conversation system, this
   model can analyze the completeness and meaning of natural language
   statements as well as allows users to edit the incomplete or faulty
   statements, and improve the model by adding new words, sentence syntaxes
   and semantic patterns for more accurate results. Evaluation of the model
   is performed by 98 testers. By inputting 1,137 natural language
   statements to the model, the results showed that the models were
   effective in retrieving and processing data accurately with very high
   values of precision, recall, and F-score which were all higher than 0.9.
   There are only 18 statements or 3.2\% of all statements that produce
   errors in the outputs which were caused by the typo in 3 cases: missing
   of some alphabets which change the word's meaning, using of the
   ambiguous words, and wrong position of words in the natural language
   statement.},

Abstract = {Text segmentation (TS) is the process of dividing multi-topic text
   collections into cohesive segments using topic boundaries. Similarly,
   text clustering has been renowned as a major concern when it comes to
   multi-topic text collections, as they are distinguished by sub-topic
   structure and their contents are not associated with each other.
   Existing clustering approaches follow the TS method which relies on word
   frequencies and may not be suitable to cluster multi-topic text
   collections. In this work, we propose a new ensemble clustering approach
   (ECA) is a novel topic-modelling-based clustering approach, which
   induces the combination of TS and text clustering. We improvised a
   LDA-onto (LDA-ontology) is a TS-based model, which presents a
   deterioration of a document into segments (i.e. sub-documents), wherein
   each sub-document is associated with exactly one sub-topic. We deal with
   the problem of clustering when it comes to a document that is
   intrinsically related to various topics and its topical structure is
   missing. ECA is tested through well-known datasets in order to provide a
   comprehensive presentation and validation of clustering algorithms using
   LDA-onto. ECA exhibits the semantic relations of keywords in
   sub-documents and resultant clusters belong to original documents that
   they contain. Moreover, present research sheds the light on clustering
   performances and it indicates that there is no difference over
   performances (in terms of F-measure) when the number of topics changes.
   Our findings give above par results in order to analyse the problem of
   text clustering in a broader spectrum without applying dimension
   reduction techniques over high sparse data. Specifically, ECA provides
   an efficient and significant framework than the traditional and
   segment-based approach, such that achieved results are statistically
   significant with an average improvement of over 10.2\%. For the most
   part, proposed framework can be evaluated in applications where
   meaningful data retrieval is useful, such as document summarization,
   text retrieval, novelty and topic detection.},

Abstract = {The similarity method has an important effect on some tasks of natural
   language processing, such as information retrieval, automatic
   translation and named entity recognition. Hypernymy/hyponymy relations
   are widespread in semantic webs and knowledge graphs, so computing the
   similarity of hypernymy/hyponymy is a key issue in the text processing
   field. All measures of both feature-based and IC-based methods have
   obvious deficiencies. The feature-based method estimated the similarity
   by the depth of the node, and the IC-based method computed the
   similarity by the position of the deepest common parent. The deficiency
   of the feature-based method and IC-based method is that they include one
   parameter, so the performance is slightly inaccurate and unstable. To
   address this deficiency, our paper proposed a hybrid method that
   computes the similarity of hypernymy/hyponymy by a hybrid parameter
   (dhype(lch)) that implies two parameters: depth of the node and position
   of the deepest common parent. Compared with several similarity methods,
   the proposed method achieved better performance in terms of accuracy
   rate, Pearson correlation coefficient and artificial fitting effect.},

Journal = {INFORMATION},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent years, information integration systems have become very
   popular in mashup-type applications. Information sources are normally
   presented in an individual and unrelated fashion, and the development of
   new technologies to reduce the negative effects of information
   dispersion is needed. A major challenge is the integration and
   implementation of processing pipelines using different technologies
   promoting the emergence of advanced architectures capable of processing
   such a number of diverse sources. This paper describes a semantic
   domain-adaptable platform to integrate those sources and provide
   high-level functionalities, such as recommendations, shallow and deep
   natural language processing, text enrichment, and ontology
   standardization. Our proposed intelligent domain-adaptable platform
   (IDAP) has been implemented and tested in the tourism and biomedicine
   domains to demonstrate the adaptability, flexibility, modularity, and
   utility of the platform. Questionnaires, performance metrics, and A/B
   control groups' evaluations have shown improvements when using IDAP in
   learning environments.},

Abstract = {Push-notifications are a communication tool leveraged by many apps to
   disseminate information, engage with their user base and provide a means
   of encouraging users to take particular actions. The nuanced intent
   behind a push is not always distinguishable to the end-user at moments
   of delivery. This work explores the text content of notifications pushed
   by a number of prominent apps in the marketplace over the period of 463
   days. We present a new ontology that defines notification Call-to-action
   (CTA) labels in use today. This facilitates greater understanding behind
   a push and is a step towards standardisation for marketing teams.
   Subsequently, we then present results of a notification dataset
   annotated with our CTA labels and propose and evaluate a CTA text
   classification task, which could facilitate improved solutions for both
   users subscribed to, and marketers creating, push-notifications.},

Title = {A systematic knowledge graph-based smart management method for
   operations: A case study of standardized management},
Journal = {HELIYON},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Standardized routine operation management (SROM) has been widely
   accepted and applied by kinds of enterprises and played a key supporting
   role. With full use of the emerging knowledgebased smart management
   technology, SROM will further increase comprehensive efficiency and save
   human resources greatly at the same time, especially for small and
   medium enterprises (SMEs). Hence, we propose a systematic
   knowledge-based smart management method to transfer SROM activities from
   human operations to automatic response by means of knowledge
   explicitation, organization, sharing and reusing, which can be further
   achieved by employing knowledge graph. We took a typical SROM instance,
   ISO 9000 implementation management, as an example to validate the
   transformation from human activities to knowledge graph-based automatic
   operation. We firstly analyzed characteristics of domain knowledge and
   constructed an ontology model according to the knowledge stability.
   Secondly, a hybrid knowledge graph construction and dynamic updating
   framework together with related algorithms were designed by deliberately
   integrating semantic similarity calculation and natural language
   processing. Thirdly, we developed a question-answering mechanism and
   reasoning system based on the ISO 9000 implementation knowledge graph to
   support automatic decision and feedback for ISO 9000 routine operation
   management including knowledge learning and processes auditing. Finally,
   the practicability and effectiveness of SROM knowledge graph has been
   validated in a SME in China, realizing the application of
   question-answering, job responsibility recommendation, conflict
   detection, semantic detection, multidimensional statistical analysis.
   The proposed method can also be generalized to support auxiliary
   optimization decision, vertical risk control, operation mode analysis,
   optimization model improvement experience and so on.},

Abstract = {Automatic word sense disambiguation (WSD) from text is a task of great
   importance in various applications of natural language processing, for
   example, in machine translation, question answering, automatic
   summarization or sentiment analysis. There are different approaches to
   finding the meaning of a word within a context, whether using
   supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised or knowledge-based methods.
   Several studies have been conducted to automatically translate from text
   to sign language, reproducing the result of the translation with a
   signing avatar, in a way that deaf users have access to informative
   contents that otherwise are highly inaccessible, because sign language
   is their mother tongue. The many proposals that have been made look
   forward to minimize these informative and communicative barriers. Sign
   languages, however, do not have as many words as the spoken languages,
   so an automatic translation must be as accurate and free of ambiguities
   as possible. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the use of public
   access big data resources, as well as appropriate techniques to access
   this type of resources for WSD tasks, illustrating their effects in a
   translation system from text in Spanish to Costa Rican Sign Language
   (LESCO). The architecture of the actual system incorporates the use of a
   folksonomy, from which the disambiguation process will benefit. When an
   exact word is not found for a given detected sense in the source text,
   the ontology will be fed back with a new relationship of hyperonymy, to
   alert the curator on the need to propose a new sign in that category,
   thus promoting an enrichment in a key component of the architecture. As
   a result of the evaluation, the most appropriate big data public
   resources and techniques for WSD for sign language will be elucidated.},

Abstract = {Semantic measures are used in handling different issues in several
   research areas, such as artificial intelligence, natural language
   processing, knowledge engineering, bioinformatics, and information
   retrieval. Hierarchical feature-based semantic measures have been
   proposed to estimate the semantic similarity between two concepts/words
   depending on the features extracted from a semantic taxonomy (hierarchy)
   of a given lexical source. The central issue in these measures is the
   constant weighting assumption that all elements in the semantic
   representation of the concept possess the same relevance. In this paper,
   a new weighting-based semantic similarity measure is proposed to address
   the issues in hierarchical feature-based measures. Four mechanisms are
   introduced to weigh the degree of relevance of features in the semantic
   representation of a concept by using topological parameters (edge,
   depth, descendants, and density) in a semantic taxonomy. With the
   semantic taxonomy of WordNet, the proposed semantic measure is evaluated
   for word semantic similarity in four gold-standard datasets.
   Experimental results show that the proposed measure outperforms
   hierarchical feature-based semantic measures in all the datasets.
   Comparison results also imply that the proposed measure is more
   effective than information-content measures in measuring semantic
   similarity.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS},

Abstract = {Due to increasing volume and unstructured nature of the scientific
   literatures in biomedical domain, most of the information embedded
   within them remain untapped. This paper presents a biomedical text
   analytics system, DiseaSE (Disease Symptom Extraction), to identify and
   extract disease symptoms and their associations from biomedical text
   documents retrieved from the PubMed database. It implements various NLP
   and information extraction techniques to convert text documents into
   record-size information components that are represented as semantic
   triples and processed using TextRank and other ranking techniques to
   identify feasible disease symptoms. Eight different diseases, including
   dengue, malaria, cholera, diarrhoea, influenza, meningitis,
   leishmaniasis, and kala-azar are considered for experimental evaluation
   of the proposed DiseaSE system. On analysis, we found that the DiseaSE
   system is able to identify new symptoms that are even not catalogued on
   standard websites such as Center for Disease Control (CDC), World Health
   Organization (WHO), and National Health Survey (NHS). The proposed
   DiseaSE system also aims to compile generic associations between a
   disease and its symptoms, and presents a graph-theoretic analysis and
   visualization scheme to characterize disease at different levels of
   granularity. The identified disease symptoms and their associations
   could be useful to generate a biomedical knowledgebase (e.g., a disease
   ontology) for the development of e-health and disease surveillance
   systems.},

Abstract = {Phytophthora cactorum, an oomycete pathogen, infects more than 200 plant
   species within several plant families. To gain insight into the
   repertoire of the infection-related genes of P. cactorum, Illumina
   RNA-Seq was used to perform a global transcriptome analysis of three
   life cycle stages of the pathogen, mycelia (MY), zoospores (ZO) and
   germinating cysts with germ tubes (GC). From over 9.8 million Illumina
   reads for each library, 18,402, 18,569 and 19,443 distinct genes were
   identified for MY, ZO and GC libraries, respectively. Furthermore, the
   transcriptome difference among MY, ZO and GC stages was investigated.
   Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed diverse
   biological functions and processes. Comparative analysis identified a
   large number of genes that are associated with specific stages and
   pathogenicity, including 166 effector genes. Of them, most of RXLR and
   NLP genes showed induction while the majority of CRN genes were
   down-regulated in GC, the important pre-infection stage, compared to
   either MY or ZO. And 14 genes encoding small cysteine-rich (SCR)
   secretory proteins showed differential expression during the
   developmental stages and in planta. Ectopic expression in the Solanaceae
   indicated that SCR113 and one elicitin PcINF1 can trigger cell death on
   Nicotiana benthamiana, tobacco (N. tabacum) and tomato (Solanum
   lycopersicum) leaves. Neither conserved domain nor homologues of SCR113
   in other organisms can be identified. Collectively, our study provides a
   comprehensive examination of gene expression across three P. cactorum
   developmental stages and describes pathogenicity-related genes, all of
   which will help elucidate the pathogenicity mechanism of this
   destructive pathogen.},

Abstract = {Cross-environment activity recognition in smart homes is a very
   challenging problem, specially for data-driven approaches. Currently,
   systems developed to work for a certain environment degrade
   substantially when applied to a new environment, where not only sensors,
   but also the monitored activities may be different. Some systems require
   manual labeling and mapping of the new sensor names and activities using
   an ontology. Ideally, given a new smart home, we would like to be able
   to deploy the system, which has been trained on other sources, with
   minimal manual effort and with acceptable performance. In this paper, we
   propose the use of neural word embeddings to represent sensor
   activations and activities, which comes with several advantages: (i) the
   representation of the semantic information of sensor and activity names,
   and (ii) automatically mapping sensors and activities of different
   environments into the same semantic space. Based on this novel
   representation approach, we propose two data-driven activity recognition
   systems: the first one is a completely unsupervised system based on
   embedding similarities, while the second one adds a supervised learning
   regressor on top of them. We compare our approaches with some baselines
   using four public datasets, showing that data-driven cross-environment
   activity recognition obtains good results even when sensors and activity
   labels significantly differ. Our results show promise for reducing
   manual effort, and are complementary to other efforts using ontologies.
