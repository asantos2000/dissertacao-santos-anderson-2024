Please follow these steps carefully and ensure all instructions are adhered to:\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Summarize the document** to understand its purpose and use it to verify if all important terms,facts, fact types, and rules are identified in subsequent steps.\n\n2. **Identify elements**:\n   - **About the elements**:\n     - **Fact**: A specific instance or statement that describes an event or condition without any directive element. Facts often involve relationships between terms or entities. Example: \"John works for X Inc.\"\n     - **Fact Type**: A general, abstract template that describes potential relationships between terms or entities, serving as a model for generating specific facts. Example: \"Person works for Company.\"\n     - **Operative Rule**: A statement that governs or constrains some aspect of the business, specifying what must be done or what is not allowed. Rules enforce compliance, limit possibilities, or prescribe specific behaviors in response to business situations. Operative rules (otherwise known as normative rules or prescriptive rules) state what must or must not happen in particular circumstances. Operative rules can be contravened: required information may be omitted, inappropriate information supplied, or an attempt may be made to perform a process that is prohibited. Example: \"A customer must provide identification before opening an account.\"\n     - **Term**: A word or a group of words that represents a specific concept, entity, or subject in a particular context.\n     - Terms, Fact, Fact Type, and Operative Rule are statements that should allow only full compliance or full contravention; partial compliance is not possible. The presence of \"or\" or \"and\" often suggests the need to separate a statement into two.\n   - **For each fact, fact type, or rule**:\n     - **Extract the statement**: Identify the exact statement or phrase from the document representing the fact, fact type, or rule.\n     - **Extract and classify Terms**:\n       - **Extract all the terms involved in the statement**. Record the level of confidence in the extraction, ranging from 0 to 1, and provide a brief reason for the confidence score.\n       - **Classify each term** as either **Common Noun** or **Proper Noun**.\n       - If a Term contains nouns separated by \"and,\" \",\", or \"or,\" split it into two or more terms. For example, \"Principal office and place of business\" should be split into \"Principal office\" and \"Place of business\".\n     - **Extract Verb Symbols**: Identify verbs, verb phrases, or prepositions that connect the terms in the statement. Record the level of confidence in the extraction, ranging from 0 to 1, and provide a brief reason for the confidence score.\n     - **Classification**: Classify the statement as either a **Fact**, **Fact Type**, or **Rule**.\n     - **Confidence**: Record the level of confidence in the classification, ranging from 0 to 1.\n     - **Reason**: Provide a brief reason for the classification score.\n     - **Source**: Note the specific paragraph or section of the document where the statement is found (e.g., \"(a)(1)\", \"(b)\").\n\n3. **Provide JSON Output**:\n   - Format your answer as per the output example below.\n   - **All values are optional**: Include as much information as is available based on the document.\n   - **Do not include any additional text or explanation outside the JSON structure**.\n\n**Output Example**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"section\": \"\u00a7 123.4-5\",\n  \"elements\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"statement\": \"A person serves a non-resident investment adviser by furnishing the Commission with process, pleadings, or papers.\",\n      \"terms\": [\n        {\n          \"term\": \"Person\",\n          \"classification\": \"Common Noun\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"reason\": \"The term is ...\"\n          \"extract_confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"extract_reason\": \"The term is ...\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"term\": \"Non-resident investment adviser\",\n          \"classification\": \"Common Noun\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.8,\n          \"reason\": \"The term is ...\",\n          \"extract_confidence\": 0.8,\n          \"extract_reason\": \"The term is ...\"  \n        },\n        ...\n      ],\n      \"verb_symbols\": [\"serves\", \"by furnishing\", \"with\"],\n      \"verb_symbols_extracted_confidence\": [0.9, 0.8, 0.7],\n      \"verb_symbols_extracted_reason\": [\"The verb is ...\", \"The verb is ...\", \"The verb is ...\"],\n      \"classification\": \"Fact Type\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"reason\": \"The statement is ...\",\n      \"source\": \"(a)\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n# Notes\n1. Level of Granularity: Extract and analyze every potential statement from the document;\n2. Contextual Interpretation: Extract explicitly stated facts, fact types, and rules;\n3. Scope of Terms: Classify every noun phrase as a term, even if it is peripheral to the main statement;\n4. Verb Symbols: Include prepositions and auxiliary phrases;\n5. Classification Nuances: Record the level of confidence range from 0 to 1;\n6. Section Handling: Strictly tie every element to its section (e.g., \u00a7 275.0-7(a)(1));\n7. Order of Presentation: Follow the sequence of the document strictly;\n8. Edge Cases: Classify it with a lower level of confidence;\n9. Output Preferences: Add timestamp and processing notes;\n10. Formatting Precision: Ensure the JSON adheres strictly to a specific schema (e.g., for use in a system).\n\n        ",

Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas. Identifying definitional rules involves analyzing the formal descriptions, enumerations, relationships, and valid values of key concepts and their components within a system.\n\n### Formal term definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal term definition defines a particular business term in a formal manner. They are categorized as:\n\n#### Subtype: Formal intensional definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal intensional definition defines the subject business term using an intensional definition: one that cites both a hypernym (a term that refers to a superset of the set referred to by the original term) and the characteristics that distinguish members of the set referred to by the original term.\n\n**Template ID**: T7\n**Template Explanation**: This template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <term 1> is the term being defined;\n2. \"of {a|an} <term 2>\"

Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas. Identifying definitional rules involves analyzing the formal descriptions, enumerations, relationships, and valid values of key concepts and their components within a system.\n\n### Formal term definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal term definition defines a particular business term in a formal manner. They are categorized as:\n\n#### Subtype: Formal intensional definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal intensional definition defines the subject business term using an intensional definition: one that cites both a hypernym (a term that refers to a superset of the set referred to by the original term) and the characteristics that distinguish members of the set referred to by the original term.\n\n**Template ID**: T7\n**Template Explanation**: This template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <term 1> is the term being defined;\n2. \"of {a|an} <term 2>\" is only required if <term 1> is an attribute term;\n3. <term 3> is the hypernym of <term 1>;\n4. <qualifying clause> is used to state the characteristics that distinguish members of the set signified
