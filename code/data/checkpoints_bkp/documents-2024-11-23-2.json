Please follow these steps carefully and ensure all instructions are adhered to:\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Summarize the document** to understand its purpose and use it to verify if all important terms,facts, fact types, and rules are identified in subsequent steps.\n\n2. **Identify elements**:\n   - **About the elements**:\n     - **Fact**: A specific instance or statement that describes an event or condition without any directive element. Facts often involve relationships between terms or entities. Example: \"John works for X Inc.\"\n     - **Fact Type**: A general, abstract template that describes potential relationships between terms or entities, serving as a model for generating specific facts. Example: \"Person works for Company.\"\n     - **Operative Rule**: A statement that governs or constrains some aspect of the business, specifying what must be done or what is not allowed. Rules enforce compliance, limit possibilities, or prescribe specific behaviors in response to business situations. Operative rules (otherwise known as normative rules or prescriptive rules) state what must or must not happen in particular circumstances. Operative rules can be contravened: required information may be omitted, inappropriate information supplied, or an attempt may be made to perform a process that is prohibited. Example: \"A customer must provide identification before opening an account.\"\n     - **Term**: A word or a group of words that represents a specific concept, entity, or subject in a particular context.\n     - Terms, Fact, Fact Type, and Operative Rule are statements that should allow only full compliance or full contravention; partial compliance is not possible. The presence of \"or\" or \"and\" often suggests the need to separate a statement into two.\n   - **For each fact, fact type, or rule**:\n     - **Extract the statement**: Identify the exact statement or phrase from the document representing the fact, fact type, or rule.\n     - **Extract and classify Terms**:\n       - **Extract all the terms involved in the statement**. Record the level of confidence in the extraction, ranging from 0 to 1, and provide a brief reason for the confidence score.\n       - **Classify each term** as either **Common Noun** or **Proper Noun**.\n       - If a Term contains nouns separated by \"and,\" \",\", or \"or,\" split it into two or more terms. For example, \"Principal office and place of business\" should be split into \"Principal office\" and \"Place of business\".\n     - **Extract Verb Symbols**: Identify verbs, verb phrases, or prepositions that connect the terms in the statement. Record the level of confidence in the extraction, ranging from 0 to 1, and provide a brief reason for the confidence score.\n     - **Classification**: Classify the statement as either a **Fact**, **Fact Type**, or **Rule**.\n     - **Confidence**: Record the level of confidence in the classification, ranging from 0 to 1.\n     - **Reason**: Provide a brief reason for the classification score.\n     - **Source**: Note the specific paragraph or section of the document where the statement is found (e.g., \"(a)(1)\", \"(b)\").\n\n3. **Provide JSON Output**:\n   - Format your answer as per the output example below.\n   - **All values are optional**: Include as much information as is available based on the document.\n   - **Do not include any additional text or explanation outside the JSON structure**.\n\n**Output Example**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"section\": \"\u00a7 123.4-5\",\n  \"elements\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"statement\": \"A person serves a non-resident investment adviser by furnishing the Commission with process, pleadings, or papers.\",\n      \"terms\": [\n        {\n          \"term\": \"Person\",\n          \"classification\": \"Common Noun\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"reason\": \"The term is ...\"\n          \"extract_confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"extract_reason\": \"The term is ...\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"term\": \"Non-resident investment adviser\",\n          \"classification\": \"Common Noun\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.8,\n          \"reason\": \"The term is ...\",\n          \"extract_confidence\": 0.8,\n          \"extract_reason\": \"The term is ...\"  \n        },\n        ...\n      ],\n      \"verb_symbols\": [\"serves\", \"by furnishing\", \"with\"],\n      \"verb_symbols_extracted_confidence\": [0.9, 0.8, 0.7],\n      \"verb_symbols_extracted_reason\": [\"The verb is ...\", \"The verb is ...\", \"The verb is ...\"],\n      \"classification\": \"Fact Type\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"reason\": \"The statement is ...\",\n      \"source\": \"(a)\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n# Notes\n1. Level of Granularity: Extract and analyze every potential statement from the document;\n2. Contextual Interpretation: Extract explicitly stated facts, fact types, and rules;\n3.

Classification Nuances: Record the level of confidence range from 0 to 1;\n6. Section Handling: Strictly tie every element to its section (e.g., \u00a7 275.0-7(a)(1));\n7. Order of Presentation: Follow the sequence of the document strictly;\n8. Edge Cases: Classify it with a lower level of confidence;\n9. Output Preferences: Add timestamp and processing notes;\n10.

Party rules are constraints that determine which parties can perform certain processes, activities, or roles, often based on characteristics like age, certification, or specific responsibilities. Identifying party rules involves analyzing the qualifications, restrictions, and access permissions required for parties to execute activities or hold certain roles in a business context.\n\n### Party restriction rules\n\n**ID**: 9.5.1\n\n**Definition**: A party restriction rule places restrictions on who can perform some processes or activities or play some roles, based on age, some other physical characteristic or capability, or training, testing, and certification in the appropriate skills.\n\n**Template ID**: T53\n**Template Explanation**: This template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <party signifier 1> is a generic term signifying all parties covered by the rule, such as \"person\", \"employee\", or \"organization\";\n2. the same term must be substituted in place of each <party signifier 1>;\n3. <qualifying clause> is used if the rule governs some proper subset of the parties signified by <party signifier 1>; the options for a <qualifying clause> are listed in subtemplate S14;\n4. <predicate 1> signifies the restricted activity or role;\n5. \"the <attribute signifier> of \" is used if some attribute of a party qualifies that party to perform the activity or play the role;\n6. <predicate 2> signifies the value of <attribute signifier>, if used, or some relationship in which a party must participate in order to qualify for the activity or role.\n\n\n**Rule Form**:\n```rule_form\nA <party signifier 1>\n  {<qualifying clause>| }\nmay <predicate 1>\nonly if {the <attribute signifier> of| } that <party signifier 1>\n  <predicate 2>.\n\n```\n\n**Fact Type Form**:\n```fact_type_form\n1. a fact type based on <party signifier 1> and <predicate 1>: for example, F344 and F347;\n2. if<attribute signifier>is not used, a fact type based on<party signifier 1> and <predicate 2>: for example, F345;\n3. if <attribute signifier> is used, a fact type of the form \"<attribute signifier> is of <party signifier 2>\": for example, F348;\n4. at least one fact type for the qualifying clause (if any), including any within either predicate, for example, F346.\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: R140\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nA person\nmay travel alone\nonly if the age of that person is at least 2 years.\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: R141\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nA person\nmay be employed as a cabin crew member\nonly if the height of that person is at least 160 cm.\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: R142\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nA passenger\nmay be allocated to a seat in an exit row\nonly if that passenger is able to open an aircraft door.\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: R143\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nA person\nmay be rostered on a flight crew\nonly if that person holds an airline transport pilot license\n  that is current\nand a type endorsement\n  that is current for each aircraft type to be flown by that flight crew.\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: R397\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nA person\nmay be rostered as the pilot in command\n  on a flight crew\nonly if that person holds a command endorsement\n  that is current.\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: R398\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nA person\nmay be rostered as a flight crew member\nonly if the current medical status of that person is A1.\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F344\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nperson is rostered as pilot in command on flight crew\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F345\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nperson holds command endorsement\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F346\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\ncommand endorsement is current\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F347\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nperson is rostered as flight crew member\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F348\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\ncurrent medical status is of person\n\n```\n\n### Role separation rules\n\n**ID**: 9.5.2a\n\n**Definition**: A role separation rule prohibits the same party from performing two activities.\n\n**Template ID**: T54\n**Template Explanation**: This template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <party signifier 1> is a generic term signifying all parties covered by the rule, such as \"person\", \"employee\", or \"organization\";\n2. the same term must be substituted in place of each <party signifier 1>;\n3. <qualifying clause 1> defines one of the activities while <qualifying clause 2> defines the other;

Activity rules are constraints on the execution of business processes or other activities, including when activities can occur, prerequisites, prohibitions, conflict management, and process-specific decisions. Identifying activity rules involves analyzing the conditions under which an activity is restricted, triggered, or must be executed within a specific time frame.\n\n### Activity restriction rules\n\n**ID**: 9.4.1\n\n**Definition**: An activity restriction rule restricts a business process or other activity in some way.

Boolean attributes indicate \"Yes\" or \"No\" responses, shown as checkboxes or \"Y/N\" fields.\n- **quantitative attribute**: An attribute on which some arithmetic can be performed (e.g., addition, subtraction) and on which comparisons other than \"=\" and \"<>\" can be performed.\n- **qualifying clause**: refines a rule's scope or specificity by limiting the subject or other terms to particular subsets or conditions (e.g., \u201cfor a return journey\u201d or \u201cthat is current\u201d).\n\n# Output Format:\n\nEach analyzed statement must be provided in JSON format. The structure for each statement is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"doc_id\": \"The Document ID from the input\",\n    \"statement_id\": \"The original statement ID\",\n    \"statement_text\": \"The original statement_text\",\n    \"statement_source\": \"The original statement_source\",\n    \"classification\": [\n        {\n            \"subtype\": \"Assigned rule subtype, use the title of the section/subsection (e.g., Activity time limit rules)\",\n            \"templates_ids\": [\"Template ID that matched the statement.\"],\n            \"confidence\": Confidence Score (0-1),\n            \"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation of why this classification was assigned.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n    \n## Example Output:\n\n```\n[\n    {\n        \"doc_id\": \"some doc id\",\n        \"statement_id\": \"some id\",\n        \"statement_text\": \"some text\",\n        \"statement_source\": \"some source\",\n        \"classification\": [\n            {\n                \"subtype\": \"Some Subtype Title\",\n                \"templates_ids\": [\"T123\", \"T456\"],\n                \"confidence\": 0.9,\n                \"explanation\": \"This statement ...\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"subtype\": \"Another Subtype Title\",\n                \"templates_ids\": [\"T789\"],\n                \"confidence\": 0.4,\n                \"explanation\": \"There are elements ...\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"doc_id\": \"another doc id\",\n        \"statement_id\": \"another id\",\n        \"statement_text\": \"another text\",\n        \"statement_source\": \"another source\",\n        \"classification\": [\n            {\n                \"subtype\": \"Subtype Title\",\n                \"templates_ids\": [\"T123\"],\n                \"confidence\": 0.7,\n                \"explanation\": \"The clause dictates ...\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    ...\n]\n```\n\n---\n\n# Additional Notes:\n1. **Reasoning**:\n   - Ensure explanations include specific references to template structure, terminology, and the alignment of predicates and conditions.\n2. **Confidence**:\n   - Provide honest confidence assessments, indicating whether the classification is clear, ambiguous, or partially aligned.\n3. **Multiple Classifications**:\n   - A statement can have multiple classifications if it aligns with different subtypes. Justify each with appropriate confidence levels.\n4. **Cross-References**:\n   - When a statement refers to another section (e.g., \"(a)(1)\"), incorporate the referenced section if it is provided or available. If unavailable, indicate this in the explanation and lower the confidence score.\n\n---\n\n",
