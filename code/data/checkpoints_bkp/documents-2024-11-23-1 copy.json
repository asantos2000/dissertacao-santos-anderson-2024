Please follow these steps carefully and ensure all instructions are adhered to:\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Summarize the document** to understand its purpose and use it to verify if all important terms,facts, fact types, and rules are identified in subsequent steps.\n\n2. **Identify elements**:\n   - **About the elements**:\n     - **Fact**: A specific instance or statement that describes an event or condition without any directive element. Facts often involve relationships between terms or entities. Example: \"John works for X Inc.\"\n     - **Fact Type**: A general, abstract template that describes potential relationships between terms or entities, serving as a model for generating specific facts. Example: \"Person works for Company.\"\n     - **Operative Rule**: A statement that governs or constrains some aspect of the business, specifying what must be done or what is not allowed. Rules enforce compliance, limit possibilities, or prescribe specific behaviors in response to business situations. Operative rules (otherwise known as normative rules or prescriptive rules) state what must or must not happen in particular circumstances. Operative rules can be contravened: required information may be omitted, inappropriate information supplied, or an attempt may be made to perform a process that is prohibited. Example: \"A customer must provide identification before opening an account.\"\n     - **Term**: A word or a group of words that represents a specific concept, entity, or subject in a particular context.\n     - Terms, Fact, Fact Type, and Operative Rule are statements that should allow only full compliance or full contravention; partial compliance is not possible. The presence of \"or\" or \"and\" often suggests the need to separate a statement into two.\n   - **For each fact, fact type, or rule**:\n     - **Extract the statement**: Identify the exact statement or phrase from the document representing the fact, fact type, or rule.\n     - **Extract and classify Terms**:\n       - **Extract all the terms involved in the statement**. Record the level of confidence in the extraction, ranging from 0 to 1, and provide a brief reason for the confidence score.\n       - **Classify each term** as either **Common Noun** or **Proper Noun**.\n       - If a Term contains nouns separated by \"and,\" \",\", or \"or,\" split it into two or more terms. For example, \"Principal office and place of business\" should be split into \"Principal office\" and \"Place of business\".\n     - **Extract Verb Symbols**: Identify verbs, verb phrases, or prepositions that connect the terms in the statement. Record the level of confidence in the extraction, ranging from 0 to 1, and provide a brief reason for the confidence score.\n     - **Classification**: Classify the statement as either a **Fact**, **Fact Type**, or **Rule**.\n     - **Confidence**: Record the level of confidence in the classification, ranging from 0 to 1.\n     - **Reason**: Provide a brief reason for the classification score.\n     - **Source**: Note the specific paragraph or section of the document where the statement is found (e.g., \"(a)(1)\", \"(b)\").\n\n3. **Provide JSON Output**:\n   - Format your answer as per the output example below.\n   - **All values are optional**: Include as much information as is available based on the document.\n   - **Do not include any additional text or explanation outside the JSON structure**.\n\n**Output Example**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"section\": \"\u00a7 123.4-5\",\n  \"elements\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"statement\": \"A person serves a non-resident investment adviser by furnishing the Commission with process, pleadings, or papers.\",\n      \"terms\": [\n        {\n          \"term\": \"Person\",\n          \"classification\": \"Common Noun\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"reason\": \"The term is ...\"\n          \"extract_confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"extract_reason\": \"The term is ...\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"term\": \"Non-resident investment adviser\",\n          \"classification\": \"Common Noun\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.8,\n          \"reason\": \"The term is ...\",\n          \"extract_confidence\": 0.8,\n          \"extract_reason\": \"The term is ...\"  \n        },\n        ...\n      ],\n      \"verb_symbols\": [\"serves\", \"by furnishing\", \"with\"],\n      \"verb_symbols_extracted_confidence\": [0.9, 0.8, 0.7],\n      \"verb_symbols_extracted_reason\": [\"The verb is ...\", \"The verb is ...\", \"The verb is ...\"],\n      \"classification\": \"Fact Type\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"reason\": \"The statement is ...\",\n      \"source\": \"(a)\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n# Notes\n1. Level of Granularity: Extract and analyze every potential statement from the document;\n2. Contextual Interpretation: Extract explicitly stated facts, fact types, and rules;\n3. Scope of Terms: Classify every noun phrase as a term, even if it is peripheral to the main statement;\n4. Verb Symbols: Include prepositions and auxiliary phrases;\n5. Classification Nuances: Record the level of confidence range from 0 to 1;\n6. Section Handling: Strictly tie every element to its section (e.g., \u00a7 275.0-7(a)(1));\n7. Order of Presentation: Follow the sequence of the document strictly;\n8. Edge Cases: Classify it with a lower level of confidence;\n9. Output Preferences: Add timestamp and processing notes;\n10. Formatting Precision: Ensure the JSON adheres strictly to a specific schema (e.g., for use in a system).\n\n        ",

Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas.

Each item enclosed in \"angle brackets\" (\"<\" and \">\") is a placeholder, in place of which any suitable text may be substituted. For example, any of the following may be substituted in place of <operative rule statement subject> (subtemplate):\n    a. a term: for example, \"flight booking request\",\n    b. a term followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"flight booking request for a one-way journey\",\n    c. a reference to a combination of items: for example, \"combination of enrollment date and graduation date\", with or without a qualifying clause,\n    d. a reference to a set of items: for example, \"set of passengers\", with or without a qualifying clause.\n2. Each pair of braces (\"{\" and \"}\") encloses a set of options (separated from each other by the bar symbol: \"|\"), one of which is included in the rule statement. For example,\n3. If a pair of braces includes a bar symbol immediately before the closing brace, the null option is allowed: that is, you can, if necessary, include none of the options at that point in the rule statement.\n4. Sets of options may be nested. For example, in each of the templates above\n    a. a conditional clause may be included or omitted,\n    b. if included, the conditional clause should be preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n5. A further notation, introduced later in this section, uses square brackets to indicate that a syntactic element may be repeated indefinitely.\n6. Any text not enclosed in either \"angle brackets\" or braces (i.e., \"must\", \"not\", \"may\", and \"only\") is included in every rule statement conforming to the relevant template.\n\n\n# Provided templates and subtemplates for transformation\n\n## T53\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S14: qualifying clause\n\n### Rule Form\n\nA <party signifier 1>\n  {<qualifying clause>| }\nmay <predicate 1>\nonly if {the <attribute signifier> of| } that <party signifier 1>\n  <predicate 2>.\n\n\n### Fact Type Form\n\n1. a fact type based on <party signifier 1> and <predicate 1>: for example, F344 and F347;\n2. if<attribute signifier>is not used, a fact type based on<party signifier 1> and <predicate 2>: for example, F345;\n3. if <attribute signifier> is used, a fact type of the form \"<attribute signifier> is of <party signifier 2>\": for example, F348;\n4. at least one fact type for the qualifying clause (if any), including any within either predicate, for example, F346.\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <party signifier 1> is a generic term signifying all parties covered by the rule, such as \"person\", \"employee\", or \"organization\";\n2. the same term must be substituted in place of each <party signifier 1>;\n3. <qualifying clause> is used if the rule governs some proper subset of the parties signified by <party signifier 1>; the options for a <qualifying clause> are listed in subtemplate S14;\n4. <predicate 1> signifies the restricted activity or role;\n5. \"the <attribute signifier> of \" is used if some attribute of a party qualifies that party to perform the activity or play the role;\n6. <predicate 2> signifies the value of <attribute signifier>, if used, or some relationship in which a party must participate in order to qualify for the activity or role.\n\n\n## S14: qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S15: and-qualifying clause\n- S9: verb part\n- S13:

substituted in place of an <object> placeholder:\n1. a term optionally preceded by a determiner and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the credit card with which the booking was paid for\", \"employees in receipt of this allowance\";\n2. a term preceded by \"the <set function> of\" and an optional determiner, and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the number of employees in the team\", \"the sum of the fares\";\n3. a literal optionally preceded by a determiner: for example, \"1 January 2012\", \"that 24 h\".\n\n\n## S5: set function\n\n### Form\n\n<set function>::=\n{number |sum| total |maximum|minimum|average|mean|median|\nlatest | earliest}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nA set function is any scalar numeric property of a set of data

integer>|\nthe {{first | last} or only|second or any subsequent|previous|next|same}|\nany {other |more}}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nOne or more determiners can be used before a noun to provide some information as to which (or how many) instances of the noun's concept are being referred to.\nThe most commonly used determiners are articles.\nSpecific determiners are used to limit the noun to referring only to a specific instance or instances.\nThere is an infinite set of ordinal numbers: 'first', 'second', 'third', etc. Any of these may be used between 'the' and a noun to indicate which member of some sequence is referred to, as in \u201cthe first stop\u201d. There are other words or phrases that may be used in a similar way.\nGeneral determiners limit the number of instances referred to by a noun without being specific as to which instance or instances are referenced. The indefinite articles ('a' and 'an') are general determiners, as are also:\n1. the cardinal numbers ('one', 'two', 'ten', etc.) and various other words defining how many instances are involved;\n2. the quantifiers 'all', 'both', 'every', 'each', 'any', 'no', etc.;\n3. 'another', 'other' (but not 'the other', which is a specific determiner);\n4. 'either', 'neither'.\nThere is an infinite set of cardinal numbers: 'one', 'two', 'three', etc. Any of these may be preceded by one of the following:\n1. 'exactly' to express a more rigorous statement as to how many instances are involved;\n2. 'at least' or 'from', to express the minimum number of instances involved;\n3. 'at most' (or 'up to'), to similarly express the maximum number of instances involved.\n\n\n## S3: cardinality\n\n### Form\n\n<cardinality>::=\n{exactly|at least {<positive integer 1> and at most| }}\n<positive integer 2>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nFor example, \"exactly one\", \"at least two\", \"at least one and at most four\".\n\n\n## S2: article\n\n### Form\n\n<article>::={a |an|the}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\n\n\n## S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<verb part>::=\n{<participle>|<adjective>| } <preposition>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <verb part> placeholder:\n1. a preposition preceded by a participle: for example, \"specified by\";\n2. a preposition preceded by an adjective: for example, \"available in\";\n3. a preposition alone: for example, \"of \".\n\n\n## S13: conditional clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S10: predicate\n- S12: expression\n- S14: qualifying clause\n- S4: determiner\n\n### Form\n\n<conditional clause>::=\n{{<determiner> <term> {<qualifying clause>| } |<expression>| it}\n{<predicate>| [<predicate> and]| [<predicate> or]} |\n[<conditional clause> and] | [<conditional clause> or]}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <conditional clause> placeholder:\n1. a single conditional clause, consisting of\n  a. either\n    i. a term preceded by a determiner and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the employee who submitted the application\",\n    ii. an expression (see subtemplate S12), or\n    iii. \"it\";\n  b. followed by one of\n    i. a single predicate (see subtemplate S10),\n    ii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"and\",\n    iii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"or\";\n2. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"and\";\n3. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"or\".\n\n\n## S10: predicate\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S6: inequality operator\n- S11: object\n- S7: equality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<predicate>::=\n{{<verb phrase>| is {<equality operator>|<inequality operator>}}\n  <object>|\n<verb phrase> {[<object>, and] | [<object>, or] | }}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <predicate> placeholder:\n1. a verb phrase followed by a single object: for example, \"is specified by that transaction\";\n2. \"is\" and an equality operator or inequality operator followed by a single object: for example, \"is equal to the fee payable\", \"is less than the maximum price\";\n3. a verb phrase followed by\n  a. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"and\" (or a comma and \"and\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"specifies a discount code and a promotion code\";\n  b. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"or\" (or a comma and \"or\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"is 0 or 1\";\n4. a verb phrase alone: for example, \"is closed\".\n\n\n## S6: inequality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<inequality operator>::=\n{{no|} {more|less | later | earlier} than|\nat {least |most} <literal> {more| later} than|\n{no|} {later | earlier} than <literal> {after |before}}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nAn inequality operator in a rule statement can be any of the following:\n1. 'more than', 'less than', 'later than', 'earlier than', 'no more than', 'no less than', 'no later than', 'no earlier than';\n2. 'at least <literal> more than', 'at most <literal> more than', 'at least <literal> later than', 'at most <literal> later than';\n3.

that order line\";\n2. a set function followed by a term with optional preceding determiner and optional following qualifying clause: for example, \"the number of order lines\", \"the sum of the extensions for each order line\";\n3. any two expressions joined by \"plus\", \"minus\", \"multiplied by\", or \"divided by\": for example, \"1 minus the discount for that customer\", \"1 minus the discount for that customer multiplied by the unit price of that product\";\n4. \"sum of\" or \"product of\", followed by a list of expressions each separated from the next by a comma and/or \"and\": for example, \"the sum of the base fare, fuel levy, booking fee, and credit card charge for that booking\";\n5. \"square\", \"cube\", \"square root\", or \"cube root\", followed by an expression: for example, \"the square of the speed of light\".\n\n\n## S18: either-or-qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S11: object\n- S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<either-or-qualifying

Each item enclosed in \"angle brackets\" (\"<\" and \">\") is a placeholder, in place of which any suitable text may be substituted. For example, any of the following may be substituted in place of <operative rule statement subject> (subtemplate):\n    a. a term: for example, \"flight booking request\",\n    b. a term followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"flight booking request for a one-way journey\",\n    c. a reference to a combination of items: for example, \"combination of enrollment date and graduation date\", with or without a qualifying clause,\n    d. a reference to a set of items: for example, \"set of passengers\", with or without a qualifying clause.\n2. Each pair of braces (\"{\" and \"}\") encloses a set of options (separated from each other by the bar symbol: \"|\"), one of which is included in the rule statement. For example,\n3. If a pair of braces includes a bar symbol immediately before the closing brace, the null option is allowed: that is, you can, if necessary, include none of the options at that point in the rule statement.\n4. Sets of options may be nested. For example, in each of the templates above\n    a. a conditional clause may be included or omitted,\n    b. if included, the conditional clause should be preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n5. A further notation, introduced later in this section, uses square brackets to indicate that a syntactic element may be repeated indefinitely.\n6. Any text not enclosed in either \"angle brackets\" or braces (i.e., \"must\", \"not\", \"may\", and \"only\") is included in every rule statement conforming to the relevant template.\n\n\n# Provided templates and subtemplates for transformation\n\n## T53\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S14: qualifying clause\n\n### Rule Form\n\nA <party signifier 1>\n  {<qualifying clause>| }\nmay <predicate 1>\nonly if {the <attribute signifier> of| } that <party signifier 1>\n  <predicate 2>.\n\n\n### Fact Type Form\n\n1. a fact type based on <party signifier 1> and <predicate 1>: for example, F344 and F347;\n2. if<attribute signifier>is not used, a fact type based on<party signifier 1> and <predicate 2>: for example, F345;\n3. if <attribute signifier> is used, a fact type of the form \"<attribute signifier> is of <party signifier 2>\": for example, F348;\n4. at least one fact type for the qualifying clause (if any), including any within either predicate, for example, F346.\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <party signifier 1> is a generic term signifying all parties covered by the rule, such as \"person\", \"employee\", or \"organization\";\n2. the same term must be substituted in place of each <party signifier 1>;\n3. <qualifying clause> is used if the rule governs some proper subset of the parties signified by <party signifier 1>; the options for a <qualifying clause> are listed in subtemplate S14;\n4. <predicate 1> signifies the restricted activity or role;\n5. \"the <attribute signifier> of \" is used if some attribute of a party qualifies that party to perform the activity or play the role;\n6. <predicate 2> signifies the value of <attribute signifier>, if used, or some relationship in which a party must participate in order to qualify for the activity or role.\n\n\n## S14: qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S15: and-qualifying clause\n- S9: verb part\n- S13: conditional clause\n- S18: either-or-qualifying clause\n- S11: object\n- S16: both-and-qualifying clause\n- S17: or-qualifying clause\n\n### Form\n\n<qualifying clause>::=\n{{that |who} <verb phrase>

clause>|\n<and-qualifying clause>|\n<or-qualifying clause>|\n<both-and-qualifying clause>|\n<either-or-qualifying clause>}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <qualifying clause> placeholder:\n1. \"that\" or \"who\" followed by a verb phrase and an optional object (see subtemplate S11): for example, \"that includes an international flight\";\n2. a verb part (see subtemplate S9) followed by an object: for example, \"specified in a real property transaction\";\n3. \"other than\" followed by either\n  a. an object, or\n  b. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"or\" (or a comma and \"or\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards) and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"other than a cash payment or a direct debit payment\";\n4. a conditional clause (see subtemplate S13) preceded by either\n  a. a preposition followed by \"which\" or \"whom\", or\n  b. \"whose\": for example, \"for which the payment is made\", \"whose name appears on the passport\";\n5. \"that\" or \"who\" followed by\n  a. a verb phrase,\n  b. \"that\", \"if\", or \"whether\", and\n  c. a conditional clause: for example, \"who checks whether the passport has expired\";\n6. a qualifying clause involving multiple criteria:\n  a. separated by \"and\", with or without \"both\", as defined in subtemplates S15 and S16,\n  b. separated by \"or\", with or without \"either\", as defined in subtemplates S17 and S18.\n\n\n## S15: and-qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S11:

Explanation\n\nSubtemplate S15 allows for any of the forms illustrated by the following examples:\n1. \"who has a passport and is booked on an international flight\";\n2. \"that is international and has more than one intermediate stop\";\n3. \"that is specified in that document and recorded on the register\";\n4. \"that is specified in that document and registered\";\n5. \"that specifies an urgency code and a rural delivery address\".\n\n\n## S11: object\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S5: set function\n- S14: qualifying clause\n- S4: determiner\n\n### Form\n\n<object>::=\n{{<determiner>|the <set function> of {<determiner>| } | } <term>\n  {<qualifying clause>| } |\n{<determiner>| } <literal>}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of an <object> placeholder:\n1. a term optionally preceded by a determiner and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the credit card with which the booking was paid for\", \"employees in receipt of this allowance\";\n2. a term preceded by \"the <set function> of\" and an optional determiner, and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the number of employees in the team\", \"the sum of the fares\";\n3. a literal optionally preceded by a determiner: for example, \"1 January 2012\", \"that 24 h\".\n\n\n## S5: set function\n\n### Form\n\n<set function>::=\n{number |sum| total |maximum|minimum|average|mean|median|\nlatest | earliest}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nA set function is any scalar numeric property of a set of data items.\n\n\n## S4: determiner\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S3: cardinality\n- S2: article\n\n### Form\n\n<determiner>::=\n{<article>|each|that |those|\n<cardinality>|at most <positive integer>|\nthe {{first | last} or only|second or any subsequent|previous|next|same}|\nany {other |more}}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nOne or more determiners can be used before a noun to provide some information as to which (or how many) instances of the noun's concept are being referred to.\nThe most commonly used determiners are articles.\nSpecific determiners are used to limit the noun to referring only to a specific instance or instances.\nThere is an infinite set of ordinal numbers: 'first', 'second', 'third', etc. Any of these may be used between 'the' and a noun to indicate which member of some sequence is referred to, as in \u201cthe first stop\u201d. There are other words or phrases that may be used in a similar way.\nGeneral determiners limit the number of instances referred to by a noun without being specific as to which instance or instances are referenced. The indefinite articles ('a' and 'an') are general determiners, as are also:\n1. the cardinal numbers ('one', 'two', 'ten', etc.) and various other words defining how many instances are involved;\n2. the quantifiers 'all', 'both', 'every', 'each', 'any', 'no', etc.;\n3. 'another', 'other' (but not 'the other', which is a specific determiner);\n4. 'either', 'neither'.\nThere is an infinite set of cardinal numbers: 'one', 'two', 'three', etc. Any of these may be preceded by one of the following:\n1. 'exactly' to express a more rigorous statement as to how many instances are involved;\n2. 'at least' or 'from', to express the minimum number of instances involved;\n3. 'at most' (or 'up to'), to similarly express the maximum number of instances involved.\n\n\n## S3: cardinality\n\n### Form\n\n<cardinality>::=\n{exactly|at least {<positive integer 1> and at most| }}\n<positive integer 2>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nFor example, \"exactly one\", \"at least two\", \"at least one and at most four\".\n\n\n## S2: article\n\n### Form\n\n<article>::={a |an|the}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\n\n\n## S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<verb part>::=\n{<participle>|<adjective>| } <preposition>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <verb part> placeholder:\n1. a preposition preceded by a participle: for example, \"specified by\";\n2. a preposition preceded by an adjective: for example, \"available in\";\n3. a preposition alone: for example, \"of \".\n\n\n## S13: conditional clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S10: predicate\n- S12: expression\n- S14: qualifying clause\n- S4: determiner\n\n### Form\n\n<conditional clause>::=\n{{<determiner> <term> {<qualifying clause>| } |<expression>| it}\n{<predicate>| [<predicate> and]| [<predicate> or]} |\n[<conditional clause> and] | [<conditional clause> or]}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <conditional clause> placeholder:\n1. a single conditional clause, consisting of\n  a. either\n    i. a term preceded by a determiner and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the employee who submitted the application\",\n    ii. an expression (see subtemplate S12), or\n    iii. \"it\";\n  b. followed by one of\n    i. a single predicate (see subtemplate S10),\n    ii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"and\",\n    iii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"or\";\n2. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"and\";\n3. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"or\".\n\n\n## S10: predicate\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S6: inequality operator\n- S11: object\n- S7: equality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<predicate>::=\n{{<verb phrase>| is {<equality operator>|<inequality operator>}}\n  <object>|\n<verb phrase> {[<object>, and] | [<object>, or] | }}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <predicate> placeholder:\n1. a verb phrase followed by a single object: for example, \"is specified by that transaction\";\n2. \"is\" and an equality operator or inequality operator followed by a single object: for example, \"is equal to the fee payable\", \"is less than the maximum price\";\n3. a verb phrase followed by\n  a. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"and\" (or a comma and \"and\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"specifies a discount code and a promotion code\";\n  b. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"or\" (or a comma and \"or\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"is 0 or 1\";\n4. a verb phrase alone: for example, \"is closed\".\n\n\n## S6: inequality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<inequality operator>::=\n{{no|} {more|less | later | earlier} than|\nat {least |most} <literal> {more| later} than|\n{no|} {later | earlier} than <literal> {after |before}}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nAn inequality operator in a rule statement can be any of the following:\n1. 'more than', 'less than', 'later than', 'earlier than', 'no more than', 'no less than', 'no later than', 'no earlier than';\n2. 'at least <literal> more than', 'at most <literal> more than', 'at least <literal> later than', 'at most <literal> later than';\n3. 'later than <literal> after', 'earlier than <literal> after', 'later than <literal> before', 'earlier than <literal> before'.\n\n\n## S7: equality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<equality operator>::=\n{the same as| different from|equal to|unequal to}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThere are various equality operators, some appropriate to non-quantitative comparisons and others to quantitative comparisons.\n\n\n## S12: expression\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S11: object\n- S5: set function\n- S14: qualifying clause\n- S4: determiner\n\n### Form\n\n<expression>::=\n{<object>|\n<set

<expression>}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of the <expression> placeholder:\n1. an object (see subtemplate S11): for example, \"the order quantity of that order line\";\n2. a set function followed by a term with optional preceding determiner and optional following qualifying clause: for example, \"the number of order lines\", \"the sum of the extensions for each order line\";\n3. any two expressions joined by \"plus\", \"minus\", \"multiplied by\", or \"divided by\": for example, \"1 minus the discount for that customer\", \"1 minus the discount for that customer multiplied by the unit price of that product\";\n4. \"sum of\" or \"product of\", followed by a list of expressions each separated from the next by a comma and/or \"and\": for example, \"the sum of the base fare, fuel levy, booking fee, and credit card charge for that booking\";\n5. \"square\", \"cube\", \"square root\", or \"cube root\", followed by an expression: for example, \"the square of the speed of light\".\n\n\n## S18: either-or-qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S11: object\n- S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<either-or-qualifying

        "content": "\nTransform each given Term definition into a structured format by matching it to the specified templates and subtemplates.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Summarize definition**: Summarize the given Term definition to understand its structure and content.\n\n2. **Use Template**:\n   - For given expression, use the templates and subtemplates (Rule Form) provided for transformation.\n   - Determine the appropriate template or subtemplate based on the structure of the expression.\n   \n3. **Replace Placeholders**:\n   - Substitute placeholders, such as `<term>`, `<verb phrase>`, `<conditional clause>`, etc., with suitable values as per the expression.\n   - For terms and names, the statement_id is the term defined by the statement.\n   \n4. **Include Qualifying Details**:\n   - Where placeholders, such as `<qualifying clause>`, require additional details (e.g., attributes or qualifiers to distinguish meaning), ensure that these are included appropriately as per the respective subtemplate.\n\n5. **Transform into Structured Format**:\n   - Once the transformation is complete, ensure it's in the correct template format.\n\n6. **Output as Structured JSON**:\n   - For every transformed expression generate a JSON object as per the specified output format.\n\n7. **Review and Validate**:\n   - Ensure accuracy in grammar and compliance with logical constructs when performing substitutions.\n   - Ensure the generated JSON is in the correct template format.\n\n8. **Assess the Transformation**:\n   - Record the confidence level and reason for the confidence score in the JSON object.\n\n\n# How to interpret the templates and subtemplates\n\nEach formulation is expressed using a template, in which the various symbols have the following meanings:\n\n1. Each item enclosed in \"angle brackets\" (\"<\" and \">\") is a placeholder, in place of which any suitable text may be substituted. For example, any of the following may be substituted in place of <operative rule statement subject> (subtemplate):\n    a. a term: for example, \"flight booking request\",\n    b. a term followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"flight booking request for a one-way journey\",\n    c. a reference to a combination of items: for example, \"combination of enrollment date and graduation date\", with or without a qualifying clause,\n    d. a reference to a set of items: for example, \"set of passengers\", with or without a qualifying clause.\n2. Each pair of braces (\"{\" and \"}\") encloses a set of options (separated from each other by the bar symbol: \"|\"), one of which is included in the rule statement. For example,\n3. If a pair of braces includes a bar symbol immediately before the closing brace, the null option is allowed: that is, you can, if necessary, include none of the options at that point in the rule statement.\n4. Sets of options may be nested. For example, in each of the templates above\n    a. a conditional clause may be included or omitted,\n    b. if included, the conditional clause should be preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n5. A further notation, introduced later in this section, uses square brackets to indicate that a syntactic element may be repeated indefinitely.\n6. Any text not enclosed in either \"angle brackets\" or braces (i.e., \"must\", \"not\", \"may\", and \"only\") is included in every rule statement conforming to the relevant template.\n\n\n# Provided templates and subtemplates for transformation\n\n## T7\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S14: qualifying clause\n\n### Rule Form\n\n{A|An} <term 1>\n  {of {a|an} <term 2>| }\nis by definition\n{a|an|the} <term 3>\n  <qualifying clause>.\n\n\n### Fact Type Form\n\n1. a categorization fact type of the form \"<term 1> is a category of <term 3>\": for example, F188 for R321; F191 for R322;\n2. if \"of {a|an} <term 2>\" is used, a fact type of the form \"<term 1> is of <term 2>\": for example, F190 for R322;\n3. the fact type that links <qualifying clause> to <term 3> (plus any fact types required for the qualifying clause itself), for example, F189 for R321; F192 and F193 for R322.\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <term 1> is the term being defined;\n2. \"of {a|an} <term 2>\" is only required if <term 1> is an attribute term;\n3. <term 3> is the hypernym of <term 1>;\n4. <qualifying clause> is used to state the characteristics that distinguish members of the set signified by <term 1> from members of the sets signified by other hyponyms of <term3>; the options for a <qualifying clause> are listed in subtemplate S14. \n\n\n## S14: qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S15: and-qualifying clause\n- S9: verb part\n- S13: conditional clause\n- S18: either-or-qualifying clause\n- S11: object\n- S16: both-and-qualifying clause\n- S17: or-qualifying clause\n\n### Form\n\n<qualifying clause>::=\n{{that |who} <verb phrase> {<object>| } |\n<verb part> <object>|\nother than {<object>| [<object>, or]} |\n{<preposition> {which|whom}|whose} <conditional clause>|\n{that |who} <verb phrase> {that | if |whether} <conditional clause>|\n<and-qualifying clause>|\n<or-qualifying clause>|\n<both-and-qualifying clause>|\n<either-or-qualifying clause>}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <qualifying clause> placeholder:\n1. \"that\" or \"who\" followed by a verb phrase and an optional object (see subtemplate S11): for example, \"that includes an international flight\";\n2. a verb part (see subtemplate S9) followed by an object: for example, \"specified in a real property transaction\";\n3. \"other than\" followed by either\n  a. an object, or\n  b. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"or\" (or a comma and \"or\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards) and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"other than a cash payment or a direct debit payment\";\n4. a conditional clause (see subtemplate S13) preceded by either\n  a. a preposition followed by \"which\" or \"whom\", or\n  b. \"whose\": for example, \"for which the payment is made\", \"whose name appears on the passport\";\n5. \"that\" or \"who\" followed by\n  a. a verb phrase,\n  b. \"that\", \"if\", or \"whether\", and\n  c. a conditional clause: for example, \"who checks whether the passport has expired\";\n6. a qualifying clause involving multiple criteria:\n  a. separated by \"and\", with or without \"both\", as defined in subtemplates S15 and S16,\n  b. separated by \"or\", with or without \"either\", as defined in subtemplates S17 and S18.\n\n\n## S15: and-qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S11: object\n- S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<and-qualifying clause>::=\n{that |who}\n{[<verb phrase> {<object>| } and]|\nis [<verb part> {<object>| } and]\n<verb phrase> [<object> and]}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nSubtemplate S15 allows for any of the forms illustrated by the following examples:\n1. \"who has a passport and is booked on an international flight\";\n2. \"that is international and has more than one intermediate stop\";\n3. \"that is specified in that document and recorded on the register\";\n4. \"that is specified in that document and registered\";\n5. \"that specifies an urgency code and a rural delivery address\".\n\n\n## S11: object\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S5: set function\n- S14: qualifying clause\n- S4: determiner\n\n### Form\n\n<object>::=\n{{<determiner>|the <set function> of {<determiner>| } | } <term>\n  {<qualifying clause>| } |\n{<determiner>| } <literal>}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of an <object> placeholder:\n1. a term optionally preceded by a determiner and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the credit card with which the booking was paid for\", \"employees in receipt of this allowance\";\n2. a term preceded by \"the <set function> of\" and an optional determiner, and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the number of employees in the team\", \"the sum of the fares\";\n3. a literal optionally preceded by a determiner: for example, \"1 January 2012\", \"that 24 h\".\n\n\n## S5: set function\n\n### Form\n\n<set function>::=\n{number |sum| total |maximum|minimum|average|mean|median|\nlatest | earliest}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nA set function is any scalar numeric property of a set of data items.\n\n\n## S4: determiner\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S3: cardinality\n- S2: article\n\n### Form\n\n<determiner>::=\n{<article>|each|that |those|\n<cardinality>|at most <positive integer>|\nthe {{first | last} or only|second or any subsequent|previous|next|same}|\nany {other |more}}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nOne or more determiners can be used before a noun to provide some information as to which (or how many) instances of the noun's concept are being referred to.\nThe most commonly used determiners are articles.\nSpecific determiners are used to limit the noun to referring only to a specific instance or instances.\nThere is an infinite set of ordinal numbers: 'first', 'second', 'third', etc. Any of these may be used between 'the' and a noun to indicate which member of some sequence is referred to, as in \u201cthe first stop\u201d. There are other words or phrases that may be used in a similar way.\nGeneral determiners limit the number of instances referred to by a noun without being specific as to which instance or instances are referenced. The indefinite articles ('a' and 'an') are general determiners, as are also:\n1. the cardinal numbers ('one', 'two', 'ten', etc.) and various other words defining how many instances are involved;\n2. the quantifiers 'all', 'both', 'every', 'each', 'any', 'no', etc.;\n3. 'another', 'other' (but not 'the other', which is a specific determiner);\n4. 'either', 'neither'.\nThere is an infinite set of cardinal numbers: 'one', 'two', 'three', etc. Any of these may be preceded by one of the following:\n1. 'exactly' to express a more rigorous statement as to how many instances are involved;\n2. 'at least' or 'from', to express the minimum number of instances involved;\n3. 'at most' (or 'up to'), to similarly express the maximum number of instances involved.\n\n\n## S3: cardinality\n\n### Form\n\n<cardinality>::=\n{exactly|at least {<positive integer 1> and at most| }}\n<positive integer 2>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nFor example, \"exactly one\", \"at least two\", \"at least one and at most four\".\n\n\n## S2: article\n\n### Form\n\n<article>::={a |an|the}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\n\n\n## S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<verb part>::=\n{<participle>|<adjective>| } <preposition>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <verb part> placeholder:\n1. a preposition preceded by a participle: for example, \"specified by\";\n2. a preposition preceded by an adjective: for example, \"available in\";\n3. a preposition alone: for example, \"of \".\n\n\n## S13: conditional clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S10: predicate\n- S12: expression\n- S14: qualifying clause\n- S4: determiner\n\n### Form\n\n<conditional clause>::=\n{{<determiner> <term> {<qualifying clause>| } |<expression>| it}\n{<predicate>| [<predicate> and]| [<predicate> or]} |\n[<conditional clause> and] | [<conditional clause> or]}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <conditional clause> placeholder:\n1. a single conditional clause, consisting of\n  a. either\n    i. a term preceded by a determiner and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the employee who submitted the application\",\n    ii. an expression (see subtemplate S12), or\n    iii. \"it\";\n  b. followed by one of\n    i. a single predicate (see subtemplate S10),\n    ii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"and\",\n    iii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"or\";\n2. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"and\";\n3. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"or\".\n\n\n## S10: predicate\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S6: inequality operator\n- S11: object\n- S7: equality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<predicate>::=\n{{<verb phrase>| is {<equality operator>|<inequality operator>}}\n  <object>|\n<verb phrase> {[<object>, and] | [<object>, or] | }}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <predicate> placeholder:\n1. a verb phrase followed by a single object: for example, \"is specified by that transaction\";\n2. \"is\" and an equality operator or inequality operator followed by a single object: for example, \"is equal to the fee payable\", \"is less than the maximum price\";\n3. a verb phrase followed by\n  a. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"and\" (or a comma and \"and\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"specifies a discount code and a promotion code\";\n  b. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"or\" (or a comma and \"or\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"is 0 or 1\";\n4. a verb phrase alone: for example, \"is closed\".\n\n\n## S6: inequality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<inequality operator>::=\n{{no|} {more|less | later | earlier} than|\nat {least |most} <literal> {more| later} than|\n{no|} {later | earlier} than <literal> {after |before}}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nAn inequality operator in a rule statement can be any of the following:\n1. 'more than', 'less than', 'later than', 'earlier than', 'no more than', 'no less than', 'no later than', 'no earlier than';\n2. 'at least <literal> more than', 'at most <literal> more than', 'at least <literal> later than', 'at most <literal> later than';\n3.

<expression>}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of the <expression> placeholder:\n1. an object (see subtemplate S11): for example, \"the order quantity of that order line\";\n2. a set function followed by a term with optional preceding determiner and optional following qualifying clause: for example, \"the number of order lines\", \"the sum of the extensions for each order line\";\n3. any two expressions joined by \"plus\", \"minus\", \"multiplied by\", or \"divided by\": for example, \"1 minus the discount for that customer\", \"1 minus the discount for that customer multiplied by the unit price of that product\";\n4. \"sum of\" or \"product of\", followed by a list of expressions each separated from the next by a comma and/or \"and\": for example, \"the sum of the base fare, fuel levy, booking fee, and credit card charge for that booking\";\n5. \"square\", \"cube\", \"square root\", or \"cube root\", followed by an expression: for example, \"the square of the speed of light\".\n\n\n## S18: either-or-qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S11: object\n- S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<either-or-qualifying

Each item enclosed in \"angle brackets\" (\"<\" and \">\") is a placeholder, in place of which any suitable text may be substituted. For example, any of the following may be substituted in place of <operative rule statement subject> (subtemplate):\n    a. a term: for example, \"flight booking request\",\n    b. a term followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"flight booking request for a one-way journey\",\n    c. a reference to a combination of items: for example, \"combination of enrollment date and graduation date\", with or without a qualifying clause,\n    d. a reference to a set of items: for example, \"set of passengers\", with or without a qualifying clause.\n2. Each pair of braces (\"{\" and \"}\") encloses a set of options (separated from each other by the bar symbol: \"|\"), one of which is included in the rule statement. For example,\n3. If a pair of braces includes a bar symbol immediately before the closing brace, the null option is allowed: that is, you can, if necessary, include none of the options at that point in the rule statement.\n4. Sets of options may be nested. For example, in each of the templates above\n    a. a conditional clause may be included or omitted,\n    b. if included, the conditional clause should be preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n5. A further notation, introduced later in this section, uses square brackets to indicate that a syntactic element may be repeated indefinitely.\n6. Any text not enclosed in either \"angle brackets\" or braces (i.e., \"must\", \"not\", \"may\", and \"only\") is included in every rule statement conforming to the relevant template.\n\n\n# Provided templates and subtemplates for transformation\n\n## T7\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S14: qualifying clause\n\n### Rule Form\n\n{A|An} <term 1>\n  {of {a|an} <term 2>| }\nis by definition\n{a|an|the} <term 3>\n  <qualifying clause>.\n\n\n### Fact Type Form\n\n1. a categorization fact type of the form \"<term 1> is a category of <term 3>\": for example, F188 for R321; F191 for R322;\n2. if \"of {a|an} <term 2>\" is used, a fact type of the form \"<term 1> is of <term 2>\": for example, F190 for R322;\n3. the fact type that links <qualifying clause> to <term 3> (plus any fact types required for the qualifying clause itself), for example, F189 for R321; F192 and F193 for R322.\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <term 1> is the term being defined;\n2. \"of {a|an} <term 2>\" is only required if <term 1> is an attribute term;\n3. <term 3> is the hypernym of <term 1>;\n4. <qualifying clause> is used to state the characteristics that distinguish members of the set signified by <term 1> from members of the sets signified by other hyponyms of <term3>; the options for a <qualifying clause> are listed in subtemplate S14. \n\n\n## S14: qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S15: and-qualifying clause\n- S9: verb part\n- S13: conditional clause\n- S18: either-or-qualifying clause\n- S11: object\n- S16: both-and-qualifying clause\n- S17: or-qualifying clause\n\n### Form\n\n<qualifying clause>::=\n{{that |who} <verb phrase> {<object>| } |\n<verb part> <object>|\nother than {<object>| [<object>, or]} |\n{<preposition> {which|whom}|whose} <conditional clause>|\n{that |who} <verb phrase> {that | if |whether} <conditional clause>|\n<and-qualifying clause>|\n<or-qualifying clause>|\n<both-and-qualifying clause>|\n<either-or-qualifying clause>}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <qualifying clause> placeholder:\n1. \"that\" or \"who\" followed by a verb phrase and an optional object (see subtemplate S11): for example, \"that includes an international flight\";\n2. a verb part (see subtemplate S9) followed by an object: for example, \"specified in a real property transaction\";\n3. \"other than\" followed by either\n  a. an object, or\n  b. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"or\" (or a comma and \"or\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards) and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"other than a cash payment or a direct debit payment\";\n4. a conditional clause (see subtemplate S13) preceded by either\n  a. a preposition followed by \"which\" or \"whom\", or\n  b. \"whose\": for example, \"for which the payment is made\", \"whose name appears on the passport\";\n5. \"that\" or \"who\" followed by\n  a. a verb phrase,\n  b. \"that\", \"if\", or \"whether\", and\n  c. a conditional clause: for example, \"who checks whether the passport has expired\";\n6. a qualifying clause involving multiple criteria:\n  a. separated by \"and\", with or without \"both\", as defined in subtemplates S15 and S16,\n  b. separated by \"or\", with or without \"either\", as defined in subtemplates S17 and S18.\n\n\n## S15: and-qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S11: object\n- S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<and-qualifying clause>::=\n{that |who}\n{[<verb phrase> {<object>| } and]|\nis [<verb part> {<object>| } and]\n<verb phrase> [<object> and]}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nSubtemplate S15 allows for any of the forms illustrated by the following examples:\n1. \"who has a passport and is booked on an international flight\";\n2. \"that is international and has more than one intermediate stop\";\n3. \"that is specified in that document and recorded on the register\";\n4. \"that is specified in that document and registered\";\n5. \"that specifies an urgency code and a rural delivery address\".\n\n\n## S11: object\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S5: set function\n- S14: qualifying clause\n- S4: determiner\n\n### Form\n\n<object>::=\n{{<determiner>|the <set function> of {<determiner>| } | } <term>\n  {<qualifying clause>| } |\n{<determiner>| } <literal>}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of an <object> placeholder:\n1. a term optionally preceded by a determiner and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the credit card with which the booking was paid for\", \"employees in receipt of this allowance\";\n2. a term preceded by \"the <set function> of\" and an optional determiner, and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the number of employees in the team\", \"the sum of the fares\";\n3. a literal optionally preceded by a determiner: for example, \"1 January 2012\", \"that 24 h\".\n\n\n## S5: set function\n\n### Form\n\n<set function>::=\n{number |sum| total |maximum|minimum|average|mean|median|\nlatest | earliest}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nA set function is any scalar numeric property of a set of data items.\n\n\n## S4: determiner\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S3: cardinality\n- S2: article\n\n### Form\n\n<determiner>::=\n{<article>|each|that |those|\n<cardinality>|at most <positive integer>|\nthe {{first | last} or only|second or any subsequent|previous|next|same}|\nany {other |more}}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nOne or more determiners can be used before a noun to provide some information as to which (or how many) instances of the noun's concept are being referred to.\nThe most commonly used determiners are articles.\nSpecific determiners are used to limit the noun to referring only to a specific instance or instances.\nThere is an infinite set of ordinal numbers: 'first', 'second', 'third', etc. Any of these may be used between 'the' and a noun to indicate which member of some sequence is referred to, as in \u201cthe first stop\u201d. There are other words or phrases that may be used in a similar way.\nGeneral determiners limit the number of instances referred to by a noun without being specific as to which instance or instances are referenced. The indefinite articles ('a' and 'an') are general determiners, as are also:\n1. the cardinal numbers ('one', 'two', 'ten', etc.) and various other words defining how many instances are involved;\n2. the quantifiers 'all', 'both', 'every', 'each', 'any', 'no', etc.;\n3. 'another', 'other' (but not 'the other', which is a specific determiner);\n4. 'either', 'neither'.\nThere is an infinite set of cardinal numbers: 'one', 'two', 'three', etc. Any of these may be preceded by one of the following:\n1. 'exactly' to express a more rigorous statement as to how many instances are involved;\n2. 'at least' or 'from', to express the minimum number of instances involved;\n3. 'at most' (or 'up to'), to similarly express the maximum number of instances involved.\n\n\n## S3: cardinality\n\n### Form\n\n<cardinality>::=\n{exactly|at least {<positive integer 1> and at most| }}\n<positive integer 2>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nFor example, \"exactly one\", \"at least two\", \"at least one and at most four\".\n\n\n## S2: article\n\n### Form\n\n<article>::={a |an|the}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\n\n\n## S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<verb part>::=\n{<participle>|<adjective>| } <preposition>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <verb part> placeholder:\n1. a preposition preceded by a participle: for example, \"specified by\";\n2. a preposition preceded by an adjective: for example, \"available in\";\n3. a preposition alone: for example, \"of \".\n\n\n## S13: conditional clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S10: predicate\n- S12: expression\n- S14: qualifying clause\n- S4: determiner\n\n### Form\n\n<conditional clause>::=\n{{<determiner> <term> {<qualifying clause>| } |<expression>| it}\n{<predicate>| [<predicate> and]| [<predicate> or]} |\n[<conditional clause> and] | [<conditional clause> or]}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <conditional clause> placeholder:\n1. a single conditional clause, consisting of\n  a. either\n    i. a term preceded by a determiner and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the employee who submitted the application\",\n    ii. an expression (see subtemplate S12), or\n    iii. \"it\";\n  b. followed by one of\n    i. a single predicate (see subtemplate S10),\n    ii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"and\",\n    iii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"or\";\n2. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"and\";\n3. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"or\".\n\n\n## S10: predicate\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S6: inequality operator\n- S11: object\n- S7: equality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<predicate>::=\n{{<verb phrase>| is {<equality operator>|<inequality operator>}}\n  <object>|\n<verb phrase> {[<object>, and] | [<object>, or] | }}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <predicate> placeholder:\n1. a verb phrase followed by a single object: for example, \"is specified by that transaction\";\n2. \"is\" and an equality operator or inequality operator followed by a single object: for example, \"is equal to the fee payable\", \"is less than the maximum price\";\n3. a verb phrase followed by\n  a. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"and\" (or a comma and \"and\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"specifies a discount code and a promotion code\";\n  b. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"or\" (or a comma and \"or\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"is 0 or 1\";\n4. a verb phrase alone: for example, \"is closed\".\n\n\n## S6: inequality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<inequality operator>::=\n{{no|} {more|less | later | earlier} than|\nat {least |most} <literal> {more| later} than|\n{no|} {later | earlier} than <literal> {after |before}}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nAn inequality operator in a rule statement can be any of the following:\n1. 'more than', 'less than', 'later than', 'earlier than', 'no more than', 'no less than', 'no later than', 'no earlier than';\n2. 'at least <literal> more than', 'at most <literal> more than', 'at least <literal> later than', 'at most <literal> later than';\n3.

<expression>}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of the <expression> placeholder:\n1. an object (see subtemplate S11): for example, \"the order quantity of that order line\";\n2. a set function followed by a term with optional preceding determiner and optional following qualifying clause: for example, \"the number of order lines\", \"the sum of the extensions for each order line\";\n3. any two expressions joined by \"plus\", \"minus\", \"multiplied by\", or \"divided by\": for example, \"1 minus the discount for that customer\", \"1 minus the discount for that customer multiplied by the unit price of that product\";\n4. \"sum of\" or \"product of\", followed by a list of expressions each separated from the next by a comma and/or \"and\": for example, \"the sum of the base fare, fuel levy, booking fee, and credit card charge for that booking\";\n5. \"square\", \"cube\", \"square root\", or \"cube root\", followed by an expression: for example, \"the square of the speed of light\".\n\n\n## S18: either-or-qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S11: object\n- S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<either-or-qualifying
