Please follow these steps carefully and ensure all instructions are adhered to:\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Summarize the document** to understand its purpose and use it to verify if all important terms,facts, fact types, and rules are identified in subsequent steps.\n\n2. **Identify elements**:\n   - **About the elements**:\n     - **Fact**: A specific instance or statement that describes an event or condition without any directive element. Facts often involve relationships between terms or entities. Example: \"John works for X Inc.\"\n     - **Fact Type**: A general, abstract template that describes potential relationships between terms or entities, serving as a model for generating specific facts. Example: \"Person works for Company.\"\n     - **Operative Rule**: A statement that governs or constrains some aspect of the business, specifying what must be done or what is not allowed. Rules enforce compliance, limit possibilities, or prescribe specific behaviors in response to business situations. Operative rules (otherwise known as normative rules or prescriptive rules) state what must or must not happen in particular circumstances. Operative rules can be contravened: required information may be omitted, inappropriate information supplied, or an attempt may be made to perform a process that is prohibited. Example: \"A customer must provide identification before opening an account.\"\n     - **Term**: A word or a group of words that represents a specific concept, entity, or subject in a particular context.\n     - Terms, Fact, Fact Type, and Operative Rule are statements that should allow only full compliance or full contravention; partial compliance is not possible. The presence of \"or\" or \"and\" often suggests the need to separate a statement into two.\n   - **For each fact, fact type, or rule**:\n     - **Extract the statement**: Identify the exact statement or phrase from the document representing the fact, fact type, or rule.\n     - **Give a unique title to the statement**.\n     - **Extract and classify Terms**:\n       - **Extract all the terms involved in the statement**. Record the level of confidence in the extraction, ranging from 0 to 1, and provide a brief reason for the confidence score.\n       - **Classify each term** as either **Common Noun** or **Proper Noun**.\n       - If a Term contains nouns separated by \"and,\" \",\", or \"or,\" split it into two or more terms. For example, \"Principal office and place of business\" should be split into \"Principal office\" and \"Place of business\".\n     - **Extract Verb Symbols**: Identify verbs, verb phrases, or prepositions that connect the terms in the statement. Record the level of confidence in the extraction, ranging from 0 to 1, and provide a brief reason for the confidence score.\n     - **Classification**: Classify the statement as either a **Fact**, **Fact Type**, or **Rule**.\n     - **Confidence**: Record the level of confidence in the classification, ranging from 0 to 1.\n     - **Reason**: Provide a brief reason for the classification score.\n     - **Source**: Note the specific paragraph or section of the document where the statement is found (e.g., \"(a)(1)\", \"(b)\").\n\n3. **Provide JSON Output**:\n   - Format your answer as per the output example below.\n   - **All values are optional**: Include as much information as is available based on the document.\n   - **Do not include any additional text or explanation outside the JSON structure**.\n\n**Output Example**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"section\": \"\u00a7 123.4-5\",\n  \"elements\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"title\": \"some title\",\n      \"statement\": \"A person serves a non-resident investment adviser by furnishing the Commission with process, pleadings, or papers.\",\n      \"terms\": [\n        {\n          \"term\": \"Person\",\n          \"classification\": \"Common Noun\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"reason\": \"The term is ...\"\n          \"extract_confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"extract_reason\": \"The term is ...\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"term\": \"Non-resident investment adviser\",\n          \"classification\": \"Common Noun\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.8,\n          \"reason\": \"The term is ...\",\n          \"extract_confidence\": 0.8,\n          \"extract_reason\": \"The term is ...\"  \n        },\n        ...\n      ],\n      \"verb_symbols\": [\"serves\", \"by furnishing\", \"with\"],\n      \"verb_symbols_extracted_confidence\": [0.9, 0.8, 0.7],\n      \"verb_symbols_extracted_reason\": [\"The verb is ...\", \"The verb is ...\", \"The verb is ...\"],\n      \"classification\": \"Fact Type\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"reason\": \"The statement is ...\",\n      \"sources\": [\"(a)\"]\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n# Notes\n1. Level of Granularity: Extract and analyze every potential statement from the document;\n2. Contextual Interpretation: Extract explicitly stated facts, fact types, and rules;\n3. Scope of Terms: Classify every noun phrase as a term, even if it is peripheral to the main statement;\n4. Verb Symbols: Include prepositions and auxiliary phrases;\n5. Classification Nuances: Record the level of confidence range from 0 to 1;\n6. Section Handling: Strictly tie every element to its section (e.g., \u00a7 275.0-7(a)(1));\n7. Order of Presentation: Follow the sequence of the document strictly;\n8. Edge Cases: Classify it with a lower level of confidence;\n9. Output Preferences: Add timestamp and processing notes;\n10. Formatting Precision: Ensure the JSON adheres strictly to a specific schema (e.g., for use in a system).\n\n        ",

A fact type of the form \"<process term> is of <object term>\", or \"<process term> is for <object term>\": for example, F313 and F316;\n2. if either of the <time restriction>(s) uses a preposition rather than a conjunction, a fact type of the form \"activity occurs <preposition> <term>\" (if <object> within <time restriction> includes <term>): for example, F326, or \"activity occurs <preposition> <temporal term>\" (if not, where <temporal term> is \"time\" or \"time period\", depending on the preposition): for example, F314, F318, F321, F324, and F328;\n3. at least one fact type for each qualifying clause (if any), including any within any <object>, for example, F315, F317, F319, and F322;\n4. at least one fact type for each conditional clause (if any), including any within either <time restriction>, for example, F329, F330, and F331.\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: R130\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nOnline check-in for a flight\nmay occur\n  only during the 24 h before the departure time of that flight.\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: R131\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nAcknowledgment of an order\nmust occur\n  during the 24 h after the receipt of that order.\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: R385\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nBag drop for a flight\nmay occur\nonly during the 4 h before the departure time of that flight.\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: R386\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nAcknowledgment of a service request\n  that is made before 2 pm\nmust occur\nbefore 5 pm on the day on which that service request is made.\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: R387\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nA daily ticket\nmay be used\nonly until 2 am on the day\n  after the day on which the ticket is validated.\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F313\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nbag drop is for flight\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F316\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nacknowledgment is of service request\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F314\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nactivity occurs during time period\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F318\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nactivity occurs before time\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F321\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nactivity occurs until time\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F324\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nactivity occurs after time\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F328\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nactivity occurs no later than time\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F315\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\ndeparture time is of flight\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F317\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nservice request is made before time\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F319\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nservice request is made on day\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F322\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nticket is validated on day\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F329\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nquantity on hand is of part\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F330\n\n**Example Text**:\n\n```example\nquantity on hand falls below reorder point\n\n```\n\n**Example ID**: F331 - No details found.\n\n##### Activity exclusion period rules\n\n**ID**: 9.4.1.1.2\n\n**Definition**: An activity exclusion period rule prohibits a business process or other activity during a particular time period.\n\n**Template ID**: T49\n\n**Template Explanation**: This template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <process term> is the term used for the activity that is subject to the restriction;\n2. <object term> is the term used for the object of the activity;\n3. <term> is the term used for either the object of the activity or the party or device performing the activity;\n4. each <qualifying clause> is used only if not all instances of the object, party, or device are subject to the rule;

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates. Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas. Identifying definitional rules involves analyzing the formal descriptions, enumerations, relationships, and valid values of key concepts and their components within a system.\n\n### Formal term definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal term definition defines a particular business term in a formal manner. They are categorized as:\n\n#### Formal intensional definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal intensional definition defines the subject business term using an intensional definition:

term.\n\n**Template ID**: T7\n\n**Template Explanation**: This template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <term 1> is the term being defined;\n2. \"of {a|an} <term 2>\" is only required if <term 1> is an attribute term;\n3. <term 3> is the hypernym of <term 1>;\n4. <qualifying clause> is used to state the characteristics that distinguish members of the set signified by <term 1> from members of the sets signified by other hyponyms of <term3>; the options for a <qualifying clause> are listed in subtemplate S14. \n\n\n**Rule Form**:\n```rule_form\n{A|An} <term 1>\n  {of

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates.

        "content": "\nYou are an expert in **SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules)**, working for regulatory bodies, auditors, or process managers.\n\nYour task is to classify 5 term(s) from a provided list into one or more **Definitional Rule subtypes**, explain each classification in detail, and assign a confidence score ranging from 0 to 1.\n\n# Approach:\nUse the **Definitional Rule subtype definitions**, associated templates, and guidelines to analyze each statement thoroughly, ensuring accurate classification.\n\n---\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Classify the Statement**:\n   - For each `statement_text`, determine its rule subtype according to the provided **Definitional Rule subtypes** and their corresponding templates.\n   - Use the provided templates, definitions, and examples to match the statement to the correct subtype.\n   - If the statement does not align with a high-level type, analyze the sublevels.\n   - The subtype to be used starts with \"subtype: <subtype name>\".\n   - You should assign a subtype and a template ID, make your best guess, justify your choice, and lower the confidence level if necessary.\n   - Templates and examples help identify subtypes.\n\n2. **Assign Confidence Level**:\n   - Assign a confidence score between **0 and 1** for each classification:\n     - **1** indicates a strong and clear match.\n     - Lower scores reflect weaker matches due to ambiguities or partial alignment.\n   - Consider both template alignment and the clarity of the statement's intent when assigning scores.\n   - Assign confidence scores to each class for the given statement, ensuring that no two classes receive the same score. If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates. Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas. Identifying definitional rules involves analyzing the formal descriptions, enumerations, relationships, and valid values of key concepts and their components within a system.\n\n### Formal term definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal term definition defines a particular business term in a formal manner.

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates.

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates.

        "content": "\nYou are an expert in **SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules)**, working for regulatory bodies, auditors, or process managers.\n\nYour task is to classify 5 term(s) from a provided list into one or more **Definitional Rule subtypes**, explain each classification in detail, and assign a confidence score ranging from 0 to 1.\n\n# Approach:\nUse the **Definitional Rule subtype definitions**, associated templates, and guidelines to analyze each statement thoroughly, ensuring accurate classification.\n\n---\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Classify the Statement**:\n   - For each `statement_text`, determine its rule subtype according to the provided **Definitional Rule subtypes** and their corresponding templates.\n   - Use the provided templates, definitions, and examples to match the statement to the correct subtype.\n   - If the statement does not align with a high-level type, analyze the sublevels.\n   - The subtype to be used starts with \"subtype: <subtype name>\".\n   - You should assign a subtype and a template ID, make your best guess, justify your choice, and lower the confidence level if necessary.\n   - Templates and examples help identify subtypes.\n\n2. **Assign Confidence Level**:\n   - Assign a confidence score between **0 and 1** for each classification:\n     - **1** indicates a strong and clear match.\n     - Lower scores reflect weaker matches due to ambiguities or partial alignment.\n   - Consider both template alignment and the clarity of the statement's intent when assigning scores.\n   - Assign confidence scores to each class for the given statement, ensuring that no two classes receive the same score. If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates. Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas. Identifying definitional rules involves analyzing the formal descriptions, enumerations, relationships, and valid values of key concepts and their components within a system.\n\n### Formal term definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal term definition defines a particular business term in a formal manner.

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates.

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates. Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas.

        "content": "\nYou are an expert in **SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules)**, working for regulatory bodies, auditors, or process managers.\n\nYour task is to classify 5 fact type(s) from a provided list into one or more **Definitional Rule subtypes**, explain each classification in detail, and assign a confidence score ranging from 0 to 1.\n\n# Approach:\nUse the **Definitional Rule subtype definitions**, associated templates, and guidelines to analyze each statement thoroughly, ensuring accurate classification.\n\n---\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Classify the Statement**:\n   - For each `statement_text`, determine its rule subtype according to the provided **Definitional Rule subtypes** and their corresponding templates.\n   - Use the provided templates, definitions, and examples to match the statement to the correct subtype.\n   - If the statement does not align with a high-level type, analyze the sublevels.\n   - The subtype to be used starts with \"subtype: <subtype name>\".\n   - You should assign a subtype and a template ID, make your best guess, justify your choice, and lower the confidence level if necessary.\n   - Templates and examples help identify subtypes.\n\n2. **Assign Confidence Level**:\n   - Assign a confidence score between **0 and 1** for each classification:\n     - **1** indicates a strong and clear match.\n     - Lower scores reflect weaker matches due to ambiguities or partial alignment.\n   - Consider both template alignment and the clarity of the statement's intent when assigning scores.\n   - Assign confidence scores to each class for the given statement, ensuring that no two classes receive the same score. If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates. Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas. Identifying definitional rules involves analyzing the formal descriptions, enumerations, relationships, and valid values of key concepts and their components within a system.\n\n### Formal term definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal term definition defines a particular business term in a formal manner.

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates. Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas.

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates.

        "content": "\nYou are an expert in **SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules)**, working for regulatory bodies, auditors, or process managers.\n\nYour task is to classify 4 fact type(s) from a provided list into one or more **Definitional Rule subtypes**, explain each classification in detail, and assign a confidence score ranging from 0 to 1.\n\n# Approach:\nUse the **Definitional Rule subtype definitions**, associated templates, and guidelines to analyze each statement thoroughly, ensuring accurate classification.\n\n---\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Classify the Statement**:\n   - For each `statement_text`, determine its rule subtype according to the provided **Definitional Rule subtypes** and their corresponding templates.\n   - Use the provided templates, definitions, and examples to match the statement to the correct subtype.\n   - If the statement does not align with a high-level type, analyze the sublevels.\n   - The subtype to be used starts with \"subtype: <subtype name>\".\n   - You should assign a subtype and a template ID, make your best guess, justify your choice, and lower the confidence level if necessary.\n   - Templates and examples help identify subtypes.\n\n2. **Assign Confidence Level**:\n   - Assign a confidence score between **0 and 1** for each classification:\n     - **1** indicates a strong and clear match.\n     - Lower scores reflect weaker matches due to ambiguities or partial alignment.\n   - Consider both template alignment and the clarity of the statement's intent when assigning scores.\n   - Assign confidence scores to each class for the given statement, ensuring that no two classes receive the same score. If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates. Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas. Identifying definitional rules involves analyzing the formal descriptions, enumerations, relationships, and valid values of key concepts and their components within a system.\n\n### Formal term definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal term definition defines a particular business term in a formal manner.

Each item enclosed in \"angle brackets\" (\"<\" and \">\") is a placeholder, in place of which any suitable text may be substituted. For example, any of the following may be substituted in place of <operative rule statement subject> (subtemplate):\n    a. a term: for example, \"flight booking request\",\n    b. a term followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"flight booking request for a one-way journey\",\n    c. a reference to a combination of items: for example, \"combination of enrollment date and graduation date\", with or without a qualifying clause,\n    d. a reference to a set of items: for example, \"set of passengers\", with or without a qualifying clause.\n2. Each pair of braces (\"{\" and \"}\") encloses a set of options (separated from each other by the bar symbol: \"|\"), one of which is included in the rule statement. For example,\n3. If a pair of braces includes a bar symbol immediately before the closing brace, the null option is allowed: that is, you can, if necessary, include none of the options at that point in the rule statement.\n4. Sets of options may be nested. For example, in each of the templates above\n    a. a conditional clause may be included or omitted,\n    b. if included, the conditional clause should be preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n5. A further notation, introduced later in this section, uses square brackets to indicate that a syntactic element may be repeated indefinitely.\n6. Any text not enclosed in either \"angle brackets\" or braces (i.e., \"must\", \"not\", \"may\", and \"only\") is included in every rule statement conforming to the relevant template.\n\n\n# Provided templates and subtemplates for transformation\n\n## T56\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S13: conditional clause\n\n### Rule Form\n\n{The|A|An| } <responsibility signifier>\n  {<qualifying clause 1>| }\nmust <verb phrase> {the |a|an} <party signifier>\n  {<qualifying clause 2>| }\n{{if |unless} <conditional clause>| }.\n\n\n### Fact Type Form\n\n1. a fact type of the form \"<responsibility signifier> <verb phrase> <party signifier>\": for example, F357;\n2. at least one fact type for each qualifying clause (if any), for example, F356;\n3. at least one fact type for the conditional clause (if any).\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThese templates have the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <responsibility signifier> is the term signifying the process, fee, duty, or tax;\n2. <qualifying clause 1> is used if necessary to specify precisely which instances of that process, fee, duty, or tax are subject to the responsibility rule;\n3. <party signifier> is the term signifying the party responsible for performing the process or liable for the fee, duty, or tax;\n4. <qualifying clause 2> is used if necessary to specify precisely which instance or instances of that party are responsible.\n\n\n## S13: conditional clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S10: predicate\n- S12: expression\n- S14: qualifying clause\n- S4: determiner\n\n### Form\n\n<conditional clause>::=\n{{<determiner> <term> {<qualifying clause>| } |<expression>| it}\n{<predicate>| [<predicate> and]| [<predicate> or]} |\n[<conditional clause> and] | [<conditional clause> or]}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <conditional clause> placeholder:\n1. a single conditional clause, consisting of\n  a. either\n    i. a term preceded by a determiner and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the employee who submitted the application\",\n    ii. an expression (see subtemplate S12), or\n    iii. \"it\";\n  b. followed by one of\n    i. a single predicate (see subtemplate S10),\n    ii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"and\",\n    iii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"or\";\n2. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"and\";\n3. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"or\".\n\n\n## S10: predicate\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S6: inequality operator\n- S11: object\n- S7: equality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<predicate>::=\n{{<verb phrase>| is {<equality operator>|<inequality operator>}}\n  <object>|\n<verb phrase> {[<object>, and] | [<object>, or] | }}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <predicate> placeholder:\n1. a verb phrase followed by a single object: for example, \"is specified by that transaction\";\n2. \"is\" and an equality operator or inequality operator followed by a single object: for example, \"is equal to the fee payable\", \"is less than the maximum price\";\n3. a verb phrase followed by\n  a. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"and\" (or a comma and \"and\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"specifies a discount code and a promotion code\";\n  b. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"or\" (or a comma and \"or\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"is 0 or 1\";\n4. a verb phrase alone: for example, \"is closed\".\n\n\n## S6: inequality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<inequality operator>::=\n{{no|} {more|less | later | earlier} than|\nat {least |most} <literal> {more| later} than|\n{no|} {later | earlier} than <literal> {after |before}}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nAn inequality operator in a rule statement can be any of the following:\n1. 'more than', 'less than', 'later than', 'earlier than', 'no more than', 'no less than', 'no later than', 'no earlier than';\n2. 'at least <literal> more than', 'at most <literal> more than', 'at least <literal> later than', 'at most <literal> later than';\n3.

example, \"the credit card with which the booking was paid for\", \"employees in receipt of this allowance\";\n2. a term preceded by \"the <set function> of\" and an optional determiner, and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the number of employees in the team\", \"the sum of the fares\";\n3. a literal optionally preceded by a determiner: for example, \"1 January

|more}}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nOne or more determiners can be used before a noun to provide some information as to which (or how many) instances of the noun's concept are being referred to.\nThe most commonly used determiners are articles.\nSpecific determiners are used to limit the noun to referring only to a specific instance or instances.\nThere is an infinite set of ordinal numbers: 'first', 'second', 'third', etc. Any of these may be used between 'the' and a noun to indicate which member of some sequence is referred to, as in \u201cthe first stop\u201d. There are other words or phrases that may be used in a similar way.\nGeneral determiners limit the number of instances referred to by a noun without being specific as to which instance or instances are referenced. The indefinite articles ('a' and 'an') are general determiners, as are also:\n1. the cardinal numbers ('one', 'two', 'ten', etc.) and various other words defining how many instances are involved;\n2. the quantifiers 'all', 'both', 'every', 'each', 'any', 'no', etc.;\n3. 'another', 'other' (but not 'the other', which is a specific determiner);\n4. 'either', 'neither'.\nThere is an infinite set of cardinal numbers: 'one', 'two', 'three', etc. Any of these may be preceded by one of the following:\n1. 'exactly' to express a more rigorous statement as to how many instances are involved;\n2. 'at least' or 'from', to express the minimum number of instances involved;\n3. 'at most' (or 'up to'), to similarly express the maximum number of instances involved.\n\n\n## S3: cardinality\n\n### Form\n\n<cardinality>::=\n{exactly|at least {<positive integer 1> and at most| }}\n<positive integer 2>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nFor example, \"exactly one\", \"at least two\", \"at least one and at most four\".\n\n\n## S2: article\n\n### Form\n\n<article>::={a |an|the}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\n\n\n## S7: equality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<equality operator>::=\n{the same as| different from|equal to|unequal to}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThere are various equality operators, some appropriate to non-quantitative comparisons and others to quantitative comparisons.\n\n\n## S12: expression\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S11: object\n- S5: set function\n- S14: qualifying clause\n- S4: determiner\n\n### Form\n\n<expression>::=\n{<object>|\n<set function> of {<determiner>| } <term> {<qualifying clause>| } |\n<expression> {plus|minus|multiplied by|divided by} <expression>|\n{sum|product} of [<expression>, and] |\n{square|cube} {root |} of <expression>}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of the <expression> placeholder:\n1. an object (see subtemplate S11): for example, \"the order quantity of that order line\";\n2. a set function followed by a term with optional preceding determiner and optional following qualifying clause: for example, \"the number of order lines\", \"the sum of the extensions for each order line\";\n3. any two expressions joined by \"plus\", \"minus\", \"multiplied by\", or \"divided by\": for example, \"1 minus the discount for that customer\", \"1 minus the discount for that customer multiplied by the unit price of that product\";\n4. \"sum of\" or \"product of\", followed by a list of expressions each separated from the next by a comma and/or \"and\": for example, \"the sum of the base fare, fuel levy, booking fee, and credit card charge for that booking\";\n5. \"square\", \"cube\", \"square root\", or \"cube root\", followed by an expression: for example, \"the square of the speed of light\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Output Format\n\n[\n    {\n      \"doc_id\": <doc_id>,\n      \"statement_id\": <statement_id or signifier>,\n      \"statement_title\": <statement_title>,\n      \"sources\": [<source>],\n      \"statement\": <statement or definition>,\n      \"templates_ids\": [<templates_id>],\n      \"transformed\": <transformed_statement>,\n      \"confidence\": <confidence_level>,\n      \"reason\": <reason_for_confidence>\n    },\n    ...\n]\n\n- **`doc_id`**: A original identifier of the given document.\n- **`statement_id or signifier`**: The original identifier of the given statement. e.g., '1', 'Person'\".\n- **`statement_title`**: The title of the given statement.\n- **`sources`**: The original sources of the given statement.\n- **`statement or definition`**: The original text of the given statement.\n- **`templates_ids`**: The template(s) used for the transformation (e.g., T1, T2, etc.)\n- **`transformed`**: The transformed statement according to template.\n- **`confidence`**: The confidence level of the transformation range from 0 to 1.\n- **`reason`**: The reason for the confidence score.\n\n# Notes\n- Use only the provided templates and subtemplates for transformation.\n- If a placeholder within an expression is not applicable or optional, consider whether it should be omitted or replaced by a suitable value.\n- Each expression may involve nested levels of substitution as indicated by the subtemplate hierarchy (e.g., a qualifying clause that contains sub-elements).\n- Ensure accuracy in grammar and compliance with logical constructs when performing substitutions.\n",

        "content": "\nTransform each given Fact Type statement into a structured format by matching it to the specified templates and subtemplates.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Summarize statement**: Summarize the given Fact Type statement to understand its structure and content.\n\n2. **Use Template**:\n   - For given expression, use the templates and subtemplates (Fact Type Form) provided for transformation.\n   - Determine the appropriate template or subtemplate based on the structure of the expression.\n   \n3. **Replace Placeholders**:\n   - Substitute placeholders, such as `<term>`, `<verb phrase>`, `<conditional clause>`, etc., with suitable values as per the expression.\n   - For terms and names, the statement_id is the term defined by the statement.\n   \n4. **Include Qualifying Details**:\n   - Where placeholders, such as `<qualifying clause>`, require additional details (e.g., attributes or qualifiers to distinguish meaning), ensure that these are included appropriately as per the respective subtemplate.\n\n5. **Transform into Structured Format**:\n   - Once the transformation is complete, ensure it's in the correct template format.\n\n6. **Output as Structured JSON**:\n   - For every transformed expression generate a JSON object as per the specified output format.\n\n7. **Review and Validate**:\n   - Ensure accuracy in grammar and compliance with logical constructs when performing substitutions.\n   - Ensure the generated JSON is in the correct template format.\n\n8. **Assess the Transformation**:\n   - Record the confidence level and reason for the confidence score in the JSON object.\n\n\n# How to interpret the templates and subtemplates\n\nEach formulation is expressed using a template, in which the various symbols have the following meanings:\n\n1. Each item enclosed in \"angle brackets\" (\"<\" and \">\") is a placeholder, in place of which any suitable text may be substituted. For example, any of the following may be substituted in place of <operative rule statement subject> (subtemplate):\n    a. a term: for example, \"flight booking request\",\n    b. a term followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"flight booking request for a one-way journey\",\n    c. a reference to a combination of items: for example, \"combination of enrollment date and graduation date\", with or without a qualifying clause,\n    d. a reference to a set of items: for example, \"set of passengers\", with or without a qualifying clause.\n2. Each pair of braces (\"{\" and \"}\") encloses a set of options (separated from each other by the bar symbol: \"|\"), one of which is included in the rule statement. For example,\n3. If a pair of braces includes a bar symbol immediately before the closing brace, the null option is allowed: that is, you can, if necessary, include none of the options at that point in the rule statement.\n4. Sets of options may be nested. For example, in each of the templates above\n    a. a conditional clause may be included or omitted,\n    b. if included, the conditional clause should be preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n5. A further notation, introduced later in this section, uses square brackets to indicate that a syntactic element may be repeated indefinitely.\n6. Any text not enclosed in either \"angle brackets\" or braces (i.e., \"must\", \"not\", \"may\", and \"only\") is included in every rule statement conforming to the relevant template.\n\n\n# Provided templates and subtemplates for transformation\n\n## T12\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S3: cardinality\n\n### Rule Form\n\n{A|An} <term 1>\n<verb phrase> by definition\n{<cardinality>|at most <positive integer>} <term 2>\n  {{for |in} {each|the} <term 3>| }.\n\n\n### Fact Type Form\n\n1. if \"{for | in} {each|the} <term 3>\" is not used, a fact type of the form \"<term 1> <verb phrase> <term 2>\": for example, F205;\n2. if \"{for | in} {each|the} <term 3>\" is used, a fact type of the form \"<term 1> <verb phrase> <term 2> <preposition> <term 3>\".\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <term 1> is the term used for the complex concept;\n2. <verb phrase> is the verb phrase used for the relationship between <term 1> and <term 2>;\n3. <cardinality> defines the number of (or the minimum number of) components; <cardinality> options are listed in subtemplate S3;\n4. <term 2> is the term used for the components;\n5. \"{for | in} {each|the} <term 3>\" is optional:\n  a. it can be used with \"each\" where there is a restriction on the number of components of one type for each component of some other type: for example, a return journey (consisting of two flights) has only one departure port for each flight: in this case, <term 3> is the term used for the component of the other type (flight in this example);\n  b. it can be used with \"the\" where there is a restriction on the number of components of one type for a single component of some other type: for example, a one-way journey (consisting of one flight) has only one departure port for that flight: in this case, <term 3> is the term used for the component of the other type (flight in this example).\n\n\n## S3: cardinality\n\n### Form\n\n<cardinality>::=\n{exactly|at least {<positive integer 1> and at most| }}\n<positive integer 2>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nFor example, \"exactly one\", \"at least two\", \"at least one and at most four\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Output Format\n\n[\n    {\n      \"doc_id\": <doc_id>,\n      \"statement_id\": <statement_id or signifier>,\n      \"statement_title\": <statement_title>,\n      \"sources\": [<source>],\n      \"statement\": <statement or definition>,\n      \"templates_ids\": [<templates_id>],\n      \"transformed\": <transformed_statement>,\n      \"confidence\": <confidence_level>,\n      \"reason\": <reason_for_confidence>\n    },\n    ...\n]\n\n- **`doc_id`**: A original identifier of the given document.\n- **`statement_id or signifier`**: The original identifier of the given statement. e.g., '1', 'Person'\".\n- **`statement_title`**: The title of the given statement.\n- **`sources`**: The original sources of the given statement.\n- **`statement or definition`**: The original text of the given statement.\n- **`templates_ids`**: The template(s) used for the transformation (e.g., T1, T2, etc.)\n- **`transformed`**: The transformed statement according to template.\n- **`confidence`**: The confidence level of the transformation range from 0 to 1.\n- **`reason`**: The reason for the confidence score.\n\n# Notes\n- Use only the provided templates and subtemplates for transformation.\n- If a placeholder within an expression is not applicable or optional, consider whether it should be omitted or replaced by a suitable value.\n- Each expression may involve nested levels of substitution as indicated by the subtemplate hierarchy (e.g., a qualifying clause that contains sub-elements).\n- Ensure accuracy in grammar and compliance with logical constructs when performing substitutions.\n",

        "content": "\nTransform each given Term definition into a structured format by matching it to the specified templates and subtemplates.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Summarize definition**: Summarize the given Term definition to understand its structure and content.\n\n2. **Use Template**:\n   - For given expression, use the templates and subtemplates (Rule Form) provided for transformation.\n   - Determine the appropriate template or subtemplate based on the structure of the expression.\n   \n3. **Replace Placeholders**:\n   - Substitute placeholders, such as `<term>`, `<verb phrase>`, `<conditional clause>`, etc., with suitable values as per the expression.\n   - For terms and names, the statement_id is the term defined by the statement.\n   \n4. **Include Qualifying Details**:\n   - Where placeholders, such as `<qualifying clause>`, require additional details (e.g., attributes or qualifiers to distinguish meaning), ensure that these are included appropriately as per the respective subtemplate.\n\n5. **Transform into Structured Format**:\n   - Once the transformation is complete, ensure it's in the correct template format.\n\n6. **Output as Structured JSON**:\n   - For every transformed expression generate a JSON object as per the specified output format.\n\n7. **Review and Validate**:\n   - Ensure accuracy in grammar and compliance with logical constructs when performing substitutions.\n   - Ensure the generated JSON is in the correct template format.\n\n8. **Assess the Transformation**:\n   - Record the confidence level and reason for the confidence score in the JSON object.\n\n\n# How to interpret the templates and subtemplates\n\nEach formulation is expressed using a template, in which the various symbols have the following meanings:\n\n1. Each item enclosed in \"angle brackets\" (\"<\" and \">\") is a placeholder, in place of which any suitable text may be substituted. For example, any of the following may be substituted in place of <operative rule statement subject> (subtemplate):\n    a. a term: for example, \"flight booking request\",\n    b. a term followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"flight booking request for a one-way journey\",\n    c. a reference to a combination of items: for example, \"combination of enrollment date and graduation date\", with or without a qualifying clause,\n    d. a reference to a set of items: for example, \"set of passengers\", with or without a qualifying clause.\n2. Each pair of braces (\"{\" and \"}\") encloses a set of options (separated from each other by the bar symbol: \"|\"), one of which is included in the rule statement. For example,\n3. If a pair of braces includes a bar symbol immediately before the closing brace, the null option is allowed: that is, you can, if necessary, include none of the options at that point in the rule statement.\n4. Sets of options may be nested. For example, in each of the templates above\n    a. a conditional clause may be included or omitted,\n    b. if included, the conditional clause should be preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n5. A further notation, introduced later in this section, uses square brackets to indicate that a syntactic element may be repeated indefinitely.\n6. Any text not enclosed in either \"angle brackets\" or braces (i.e., \"must\", \"not\", \"may\", and \"only\") is included in every rule statement conforming to the relevant template.\n\n\n# Provided templates and subtemplates for transformation\n\n## T7\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S14: qualifying clause\n\n### Rule Form\n\n{A|An} <term 1>\n  {of {a|an} <term 2>| }\nis by definition\n{a|an|the} <term 3>\n  <qualifying clause>.\n\n\n### Fact Type Form\n\n1. a categorization fact type of the form \"<term 1> is a category of <term 3>\": for example, F188 for R321; F191 for R322;\n2. if \"of {a|an} <term 2>\" is used, a fact type of the form \"<term 1> is of <term 2>\": for example, F190 for R322;\n3. the fact type that links <qualifying clause> to <term 3> (plus any fact types required for the qualifying clause itself), for example, F189 for R321; F192 and F193 for R322.\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <term 1> is the term being defined;\n2. \"of {a|an} <term 2>\" is only required if <term 1> is an attribute term;\n3. <term 3> is the hypernym of <term 1>;\n4. <qualifying clause> is used to state the characteristics that distinguish members of the set signified by <term 1> from members of the sets signified by other hyponyms of <term3>;

There are other words or phrases that may be used in a similar way.\nGeneral determiners limit the number of instances referred to by a noun without being specific as to which instance or instances are referenced. The indefinite articles ('a' and 'an') are general determiners, as are also:\n1. the cardinal numbers ('one', 'two', 'ten', etc.) and various other words defining how many instances are involved;\n2. the quantifiers 'all', 'both', 'every', 'each', 'any', 'no', etc.;\n3. 'another', 'other' (but not 'the other', which is a specific determiner);\n4. 'either', 'neither'.\nThere is an infinite set of cardinal numbers: 'one', 'two', 'three', etc. Any of these may be preceded by one of the following:\n1. 'exactly' to express a more rigorous statement as to how many instances are involved;\n2. 'at least' or 'from', to express the minimum number of instances involved;\n3. 'at most' (or 'up to'), to similarly express the maximum number of instances involved.\n\n\n## S3: cardinality\n\n### Form\n\n<cardinality>::=\n{exactly|at least {<positive integer 1> and at most| }}\n<positive integer 2>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nFor example, \"exactly one\", \"at least two\", \"at least one and at most four\".\n\n\n## S2: article\n\n### Form\n\n<article>::={a |an|the}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\n\n\n## S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<verb part>::=\n{<participle>|<adjective>| } <preposition>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <verb part> placeholder:\n1. a preposition preceded by a participle: for example, \"specified by\";\n2. a preposition preceded by an adjective: for example, \"available in\";\n3. a preposition alone: for example, \"of \".\n\n\n## S13: conditional clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S10: predicate\n- S12: expression\n- S14: qualifying clause\n- S4: determiner\n\n### Form\n\n<conditional clause>::=\n{{<determiner> <term> {<qualifying clause>| } |<expression>| it}\n{<predicate>| [<predicate> and]| [<predicate> or]} |\n[<conditional clause> and] | [<conditional clause> or]}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <conditional clause> placeholder:\n1. a single conditional clause, consisting of\n  a. either\n    i. a term preceded by a determiner and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the employee who submitted the application\",\n    ii. an expression (see subtemplate S12), or\n    iii. \"it\";\n  b. followed by one of\n    i. a single predicate (see subtemplate S10),\n    ii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"and\",\n    iii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"or\";\n2. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"and\";\n3. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"or\".\n\n\n## S10: predicate\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S6: inequality operator\n- S11: object\n- S7: equality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<predicate>::=\n{{<verb phrase>| is {<equality operator>|<inequality operator>}}\n  <object>|\n<verb phrase> {[<object>, and] | [<object>, or] | }}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <predicate> placeholder:\n1. a verb phrase followed by a single object: for example, \"is specified by that transaction\";\n2. \"is\" and an equality operator or inequality operator followed by a single object: for example, \"is equal to the fee payable\", \"is less than the maximum price\";\n3. a verb phrase followed by\n  a. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"and\" (or a comma and \"and\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"specifies a discount code and a promotion code\";\n  b. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"or\" (or a comma and \"or\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"is 0 or 1\";\n4. a verb phrase alone: for example, \"is closed\".\n\n\n## S6: inequality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<inequality operator>::=\n{{no|} {more|less | later | earlier} than|\nat {least |most} <literal> {more| later} than|\n{no|} {later | earlier} than <literal> {after |before}}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nAn inequality operator in a rule statement can be any of the following:\n1. 'more than', 'less than', 'later than', 'earlier than', 'no more than', 'no less than', 'no later than', 'no earlier than';\n2. 'at least <literal> more than', 'at most <literal> more than', 'at least <literal> later than', 'at most <literal> later than';\n3.

that order line\";\n2. a set function followed by a term with optional preceding determiner and optional following qualifying clause: for example, \"the number of order lines\", \"the sum of the extensions for each order line\";\n3. any two expressions joined by \"plus\", \"minus\", \"multiplied by\", or \"divided by\": for example, \"1 minus the discount for that customer\", \"1 minus the discount for that customer multiplied by the unit price of that product\";\n4. \"sum of\" or \"product of\", followed by a list of expressions each separated from the next by a comma and/or \"and\": for example, \"the sum of the base fare, fuel levy, booking fee, and credit card charge for that booking\";\n5. \"square\", \"cube\", \"square root\", or \"cube root\", followed by an expression: for

        "content": "\nTransform each given Name definition into a structured format by matching it to the specified templates and subtemplates.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Summarize definition**: Summarize the given Name definition to understand its structure and content.\n\n2. **Use Template**:\n   - For given expression, use the templates and subtemplates (Rule Form) provided for transformation.\n   - Determine the appropriate template or subtemplate based on the structure of the expression.\n   \n3. **Replace Placeholders**:\n   - Substitute placeholders, such as `<term>`, `<verb phrase>`, `<conditional clause>`, etc., with suitable values as per the expression.\n   - For terms and names, the statement_id is the term defined by the statement.\n   \n4. **Include Qualifying Details**:\n   - Where placeholders, such as `<qualifying clause>`, require additional details (e.g., attributes or qualifiers to distinguish meaning), ensure that these are included appropriately as per the respective subtemplate.\n\n5. **Transform into Structured Format**:\n   - Once the transformation is complete, ensure it's in the correct template format.\n\n6. **Output as Structured JSON**:\n   - For every transformed expression generate a JSON object as per the specified output format.\n\n7. **Review and Validate**:\n   - Ensure accuracy in grammar and compliance with logical constructs when performing substitutions.\n   - Ensure the generated JSON is in the correct template format.\n\n8. **Assess the Transformation**:\n   - Record the confidence level and reason for the confidence score in the JSON object.\n\n\n# How to interpret the templates and subtemplates\n\nEach formulation is expressed using a template, in which the various symbols have the following meanings:\n\n1. Each item enclosed in \"angle brackets\" (\"<\" and \">\") is a placeholder, in place of which any suitable text may be substituted. For example, any of the following may be substituted in place of <operative rule statement subject> (subtemplate):\n    a. a term: for example, \"flight booking request\",\n    b. a term followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"flight booking request for a one-way journey\",\n    c. a reference to a combination of items: for example, \"combination of enrollment date and graduation date\", with or without a qualifying clause,\n    d. a reference to a set of items: for example, \"set of passengers\", with or without a qualifying clause.\n2. Each pair of braces (\"{\" and \"}\") encloses a set of options (separated from each other by the bar symbol: \"|\"), one of which is included in the rule statement. For example,\n3. If a pair of braces includes a bar symbol immediately before the closing brace, the null option is allowed: that is, you can, if necessary, include none of the options at that point in the rule statement.\n4. Sets of options may be nested. For example, in each of the templates above\n    a. a conditional clause may be included or omitted,\n    b. if included, the conditional clause should be preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n5. A further notation, introduced later in this section, uses square brackets to indicate that a syntactic element may be repeated indefinitely.\n6. Any text not enclosed in either \"angle brackets\" or braces (i.e., \"must\", \"not\", \"may\", and \"only\") is included in every rule statement conforming to the relevant template.\n\n\n# Provided templates and subtemplates for transformation\n\n## T7\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S14: qualifying clause\n\n### Rule Form\n\n{A|An} <term 1>\n  {of {a|an} <term 2>| }\nis by definition\n{a|an|the} <term 3>\n  <qualifying clause>.\n\n\n### Fact Type Form\n\n1. a categorization fact type of the form \"<term 1> is a category of <term 3>\": for example, F188 for R321; F191 for R322;\n2. if \"of {a|an} <term 2>\" is used, a fact type of the form \"<term 1> is of <term 2>\": for example, F190 for R322;\n3. the fact type that links <qualifying clause> to <term 3> (plus any fact types required for the qualifying clause itself), for example, F189 for R321; F192 and F193 for R322.\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThis template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <term 1> is the term being defined;\n2. \"of {a|an} <term 2>\" is only required if <term 1> is an attribute term;\n3. <term 3> is the hypernym of <term 1>;\n4. <qualifying clause> is used to state the characteristics that distinguish members of the set signified by <term 1> from members of the sets signified by other hyponyms of <term3>; the options for a <qualifying clause> are listed in subtemplate S14. \n\n\n## S14: qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S15: and-qualifying clause\n- S9: verb part\n- S13: conditional clause\n- S18: either-or-qualifying clause\n- S11: object\n- S16: both-and-qualifying clause\n- S17: or-qualifying clause\n\n### Form\n\n<qualifying clause>::=\n{{that |who} <verb phrase> {<object>| } |\n<verb part> <object>|\nother than {<object>| [<object>, or]} |\n{<preposition> {which|whom}|whose} <conditional clause>|\n{that |who} <verb phrase> {that | if |whether} <conditional clause>|\n<and-qualifying clause>|\n<or-qualifying clause>|\n<both-and-qualifying clause>|\n<either-or-qualifying clause>}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <qualifying clause> placeholder:\n1. \"that\" or \"who\" followed by a verb phrase and an optional object (see subtemplate S11): for example, \"that includes an international flight\";\n2. a verb part (see subtemplate S9) followed by an object: for example, \"specified in a real property transaction\";\n3. \"other than\" followed by either\n  a. an object, or\n  b. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"or\" (or a comma and \"or\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards) and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"other than a cash payment or a direct debit payment\";\n4. a conditional clause (see subtemplate S13) preceded by either\n  a. a preposition followed by \"which\" or \"whom\", or\n  b. \"whose\": for example, \"for which the payment is made\", \"whose name appears on the passport\";\n5. \"that\" or \"who\" followed by\n  a. a verb phrase,\n  b. \"that\", \"if\", or \"whether\", and\n  c. a conditional clause: for example, \"who checks whether the passport has expired\";\n6. a qualifying clause involving multiple criteria:\n  a. separated by \"and\", with or without \"both\", as defined in subtemplates S15 and S16,\n  b. separated by \"or\", with or without \"either\", as defined in subtemplates S17 and S18.\n\n\n## S15: and-qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S11: object\n- S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<and-qualifying clause>::=\n{that |who}\n{[<verb phrase> {<object>| } and]|\nis [<verb part> {<object>| } and]\n<verb phrase> [<object> and]}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nSubtemplate S15 allows for any of the forms illustrated by the following examples:\n1. \"who has a passport and is booked on an international flight\";\n2. \"that is international and has more than one intermediate stop\";\n3. \"that is specified in that document and recorded on the register\";\n4. \"that is specified in that document and registered\";\n5. \"that specifies an urgency code and a rural delivery address\".\n\n\n## S11: object\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S5: set function\n- S14: qualifying clause\n- S4: determiner\n\n### Form\n\n<object>::=\n{{<determiner>|the <set function> of {<determiner>| } | } <term>\n  {<qualifying clause>| } |\n{<determiner>| } <literal>}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of an <object> placeholder:\n1. a term optionally preceded by a determiner and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the credit card with which the booking was paid for\", \"employees in receipt of this allowance\";\n2. a term preceded by \"the <set function> of\" and an optional determiner, and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the number of employees in the team\", \"the sum of the fares\";\n3. a literal optionally preceded by a determiner: for example, \"1 January 2012\", \"that 24 h\".\n\n\n## S5: set function\n\n### Form\n\n<set function>::=\n{number |sum| total |maximum|minimum|average|mean|median|\nlatest | earliest}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nA set function is any scalar numeric property of a set of data items.\n\n\n## S4: determiner\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S3: cardinality\n- S2: article\n\n### Form\n\n<determiner>::=\n{<article>|each|that |those|\n<cardinality>|at most <positive integer>|\nthe {{first | last} or only|second or any subsequent|previous|next|same}|\nany {other |more}}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nOne or more determiners can be used before a noun to provide some information as to which (or how many) instances of the noun's concept are being referred to.\nThe most commonly used determiners are articles.\nSpecific determiners are used to limit the noun to referring only to a specific instance or instances.\nThere is an infinite set of ordinal numbers: 'first', 'second', 'third', etc. Any of these may be used between 'the' and a noun to indicate which member of some sequence is referred to, as in \u201cthe first stop\u201d. There are other words or phrases that may be used in a similar way.\nGeneral determiners limit the number of instances referred to by a noun without being specific as to which instance or instances are referenced. The indefinite articles ('a' and 'an') are general determiners, as are also:\n1. the cardinal numbers ('one', 'two', 'ten', etc.) and various other words defining how many instances are involved;\n2. the quantifiers 'all', 'both', 'every', 'each', 'any', 'no', etc.;\n3. 'another', 'other' (but not 'the other', which is a specific determiner);\n4. 'either', 'neither'.\nThere is an infinite set of cardinal numbers: 'one', 'two', 'three', etc. Any of these may be preceded by one of the following:\n1. 'exactly' to express a more rigorous statement as to how many instances are involved;\n2. 'at least' or 'from', to express the minimum number of instances involved;\n3. 'at most' (or 'up to'), to similarly express the maximum number of instances involved.\n\n\n## S3: cardinality\n\n### Form\n\n<cardinality>::=\n{exactly|at least {<positive integer 1> and at most| }}\n<positive integer 2>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nFor example, \"exactly one\", \"at least two\", \"at least one and at most four\".\n\n\n## S2: article\n\n### Form\n\n<article>::={a |an|the}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\n\n\n## S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<verb part>::=\n{<participle>|<adjective>| } <preposition>\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <verb part> placeholder:\n1. a preposition preceded by a participle: for example, \"specified by\";\n2. a preposition preceded by an adjective: for example, \"available in\";\n3. a preposition alone: for example, \"of \".\n\n\n## S13: conditional clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S10: predicate\n- S12: expression\n- S14: qualifying clause\n- S4: determiner\n\n### Form\n\n<conditional clause>::=\n{{<determiner> <term> {<qualifying clause>| } |<expression>| it}\n{<predicate>| [<predicate> and]| [<predicate> or]} |\n[<conditional clause> and] | [<conditional clause> or]}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <conditional clause> placeholder:\n1. a single conditional clause, consisting of\n  a. either\n    i. a term preceded by a determiner and optionally followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"the employee who submitted the application\",\n    ii. an expression (see subtemplate S12), or\n    iii. \"it\";\n  b. followed by one of\n    i. a single predicate (see subtemplate S10),\n    ii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"and\",\n    iii. a list of predicates, each pair of predicates in the list separated by \"or\";\n2. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"and\";\n3. a list of conditional clauses, each pair of clauses in the list separated by \"or\".\n\n\n## S10: predicate\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S6: inequality operator\n- S11: object\n- S7: equality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<predicate>::=\n{{<verb phrase>| is {<equality operator>|<inequality operator>}}\n  <object>|\n<verb phrase> {[<object>, and] | [<object>, or] | }}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of a <predicate> placeholder:\n1. a verb phrase followed by a single object: for example, \"is specified by that transaction\";\n2. \"is\" and an equality operator or inequality operator followed by a single object: for example, \"is equal to the fee payable\", \"is less than the maximum price\";\n3. a verb phrase followed by\n  a. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"and\" (or a comma and \"and\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"specifies a discount code and a promotion code\";\n  b. a list of objects, the last two objects in the list separated by \"or\" (or a comma and \"or\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of objects in the list separated by a comma: for example, \"is 0 or 1\";\n4. a verb phrase alone: for example, \"is closed\".\n\n\n## S6: inequality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<inequality operator>::=\n{{no|} {more|less | later | earlier} than|\nat {least |most} <literal> {more| later} than|\n{no|} {later | earlier} than <literal> {after |before}}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nAn inequality operator in a rule statement can be any of the following:\n1. 'more than', 'less than', 'later than', 'earlier than', 'no more than', 'no less than', 'no later than', 'no earlier than';\n2. 'at least <literal> more than', 'at most <literal> more than', 'at least <literal> later than', 'at most <literal> later than';\n3. 'later than <literal> after', 'earlier than <literal> after', 'later than <literal> before', 'earlier than <literal> before'.\n\n\n## S7: equality operator\n\n### Form\n\n<equality operator>::=\n{the

<expression>}\n\n\n### Explanation\n\nThus any of the following can be substituted in place of the <expression> placeholder:\n1. an object (see subtemplate S11): for example, \"the order quantity of that order line\";\n2. a set function followed by a term with optional preceding determiner and optional following qualifying clause: for example, \"the number of order lines\", \"the sum of the extensions for each order line\";\n3. any two expressions joined by \"plus\", \"minus\", \"multiplied by\", or \"divided by\": for example, \"1 minus the discount for that customer\", \"1 minus the discount for that customer multiplied by the unit price of that product\";\n4. \"sum of\" or \"product of\", followed by a list of expressions each separated from the next by a comma and/or \"and\": for example, \"the sum of the base fare, fuel levy, booking fee, and credit card charge for that booking\";\n5. \"square\", \"cube\", \"square root\", or \"cube root\", followed by an expression: for example, \"the square of the speed of light\".\n\n\n## S18: either-or-qualifying clause\n\n### Subtemplate(s) in use\n- S11: object\n- S9: verb part\n\n### Form\n\n<either-or-qualifying
