Please follow these steps carefully and ensure all instructions are adhered to:\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Summarize the document** to understand its purpose and use it to verify if all important terms,facts, fact types, and rules are identified in subsequent steps.\n\n2. **Identify elements**:\n   - **About the elements**:\n     - **Fact**: A specific instance or statement that describes an event or condition without any directive element. Facts often involve relationships between terms or entities. Example: \"John works for X Inc.\"\n     - **Fact Type**: A general, abstract template that describes potential relationships between terms or entities, serving as a model for generating specific facts. Example: \"Person works for Company.\"\n     - **Operative Rule**: A statement that governs or constrains some aspect of the business, specifying what must be done or what is not allowed. Rules enforce compliance, limit possibilities, or prescribe specific behaviors in response to business situations. Operative rules (otherwise known as normative rules or prescriptive rules) state what must or must not happen in particular circumstances. Operative rules can be contravened: required information may be omitted, inappropriate information supplied, or an attempt may be made to perform a process that is prohibited. Example: \"A customer must provide identification before opening an account.\"\n     - **Term**: A word or a group of words that represents a specific concept, entity, or subject in a particular context.\n     - Terms, Fact, Fact Type, and Operative Rule are statements that should allow only full compliance or full contravention; partial compliance is not possible. The presence of \"or\" or \"and\" often suggests the need to separate a statement into two.\n   - **For each fact, fact type, or rule**:\n     - **Extract the statement**: Identify the exact statement or phrase from the document representing the fact, fact type, or rule.\n     - **Give a unique title to the statement**.\n     - **Extract and classify Terms**:\n       - **Extract all the terms involved in the statement**. Record the level of confidence in the extraction, ranging from 0 to 1, and provide a brief reason for the confidence score.\n       - **Classify each term** as either **Common Noun** or **Proper Noun**.\n       - If a Term contains nouns separated by \"and,\" \",\", or \"or,\" split it into two or more terms. For example, \"Principal office and place of business\" should be split into \"Principal office\" and \"Place of business\".\n     - **Extract Verb Symbols**: Identify verbs, verb phrases, or prepositions that connect the terms in the statement. Record the level of confidence in the extraction, ranging from 0 to 1, and provide a brief reason for the confidence score.\n     - **Classification**: Classify the statement as either a **Fact**, **Fact Type**, or **Rule**.\n     - **Confidence**: Record the level of confidence in the classification, ranging from 0 to 1.\n     - **Reason**: Provide a brief reason for the classification score.\n     - **Source**: Note the specific paragraph or section of the document where the statement is found (e.g., \"(a)(1)\", \"(b)\").\n\n3. **Provide JSON Output**:\n   - Format your answer as per the output example below.\n   - **All values are optional**: Include as much information as is available based on the document.\n   - **Do not include any additional text or explanation outside the JSON structure**.\n\n**Output Example**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"section\": \"\u00a7 123.4-5\",\n  \"elements\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"title\": \"some title\",\n      \"statement\": \"A person serves a non-resident investment adviser by furnishing the Commission with process, pleadings, or papers.\",\n      \"terms\": [\n        {\n          \"term\": \"Person\",\n          \"classification\": \"Common Noun\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"reason\": \"The term is ...\"\n          \"extract_confidence\": 0.9,\n          \"extract_reason\": \"The term is ...\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"term\": \"Non-resident investment adviser\",\n          \"classification\": \"Common Noun\",\n          \"confidence\": 0.8,\n          \"reason\": \"The term is ...\",\n          \"extract_confidence\": 0.8,\n          \"extract_reason\": \"The term is ...\"  \n        },\n        ...\n      ],\n      \"verb_symbols\": [\"serves\", \"by furnishing\", \"with\"],\n      \"verb_symbols_extracted_confidence\": [0.9, 0.8, 0.7],\n      \"verb_symbols_extracted_reason\": [\"The verb is ...\", \"The verb is ...\", \"The verb is ...\"],\n      \"classification\": \"Fact Type\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"reason\": \"The statement is ...\",\n      \"sources\": [\"(a)\"]\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n# Notes\n1. Level of Granularity: Extract and analyze every potential statement from the document;\n2. Contextual Interpretation: Extract explicitly stated facts, fact types, and rules;\n3. Scope of Terms: Classify every noun phrase as a term, even if it is peripheral to the main statement;\n4. Verb Symbols: Include prepositions and auxiliary phrases;\n5. Classification Nuances: Record the level of confidence range from 0 to 1;\n6. Section Handling: Strictly tie every element to its section (e.g., \u00a7 275.0-7(a)(1));\n7. Order of Presentation: Follow the sequence of the document strictly;\n8. Edge Cases: Classify it with a lower level of confidence;\n9. Output Preferences: Add timestamp and processing notes;\n10. Formatting Precision: Ensure the JSON adheres strictly to a specific schema (e.g., for use in a system).\n\n        ",

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Operative Rule subtypes\n\n## Activity rules\n\n**ID**: 9.4\n\n**Definition**: Activity rules (all of which are operative rules) constrain the operation of one or more business processes or other activities. Activity rules are constraints on the execution of business processes or other activities, including when activities can occur, prerequisites, prohibitions, conflict management, and process-specific decisions. Identifying activity rules involves analyzing the conditions under which an activity is restricted, triggered, or must be executed within a specific time frame.\n\n### Activity restriction rules\n\n**ID**: 9.4.1\n\n**Definition**: An activity restriction rule restricts a business process or other activity in some way. There are various subcategories of activity restriction rules:\n\n#### Rules restricting when an activity can occur\n\n**ID**: 9.4.1.1\n\n**Definition**: Many activity restriction rules place time restrictions on activities.\n\n##### Activity time limit rules\n\n**ID**: 9.4.1.1.1\n\n**Definition**: An activity time limit rule restricts a business process or other activity to within a particular time period.\n\n**Template ID**: T48\n\n**Template Explanation**: This template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <process term> is the term used for the activity that is subject to the restriction;\n2. <object term> is the term used for the object of the activity;\n3. <term> is the term used for either the object of the activity or the party or device performing the activity;\n4. each <qualifying clause> is used only if not all instances of the object, party, or device are subject to the rule; the options for <qualifying clause> are listed in subtemplate S14;\n5. \"must\" should be used if the activity must occur during the period defined by the <time restrictions>, whereas \"must not\" should be used if the activity must not occur during that period, and \"may\" with \"only\" should be used if the activity may only occur during that period;\n6. <verb phrase> after \"must\", \"must not\", or \"may\" is followed by an <object> if transitive (e.g., \"be used by\", \"be operated by\") but not if intransitive (e.g., \"be used\", \"be operated\");\n7. up to two <time restriction>(s) may be used to define the period during which the activity must occur, must not occur, or may only occur; the options for <time restriction> are listed in subtemplate S21;\n8. \"{if |unless} <conditional clause>\" is required if and only if no <time restriction> is used; the options for <conditional clause> are listed in subtemplate S13.\n\n\n**Rule Form**:\n```rule_form\n{The| } <process term> {of | for} {a|an} <object term>\n  {<qualifying clause>| }\n{must {not| } occur|may occur only}\n<time restriction 1> {{and| or} <time restriction 2>| }\n{{if |unless} <conditional clause>| }.\n\n```\n\n**Fact Type Form**:\n```fact_type_form\n1.

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates. Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas. Identifying definitional rules involves analyzing the formal descriptions, enumerations, relationships, and valid values of key concepts and their components within a system.\n\n### Formal term definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal term definition defines a particular business term in a formal manner. They are categorized as:\n\n#### Formal intensional definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal intensional definition defines the subject business term using an intensional definition: one that cites both a hypernym (a term that refers to a superset of the set referred to by the original term) and the characteristics that distinguish members of the set referred to by the original

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates. Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas. Identifying definitional rules involves analyzing the formal descriptions, enumerations, relationships, and valid values of key concepts and their components within a system.\n\n### Formal term definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal term definition defines a particular business term in a formal manner.

        "content": "\nYou are an expert in **SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules)**, working for regulatory bodies, auditors, or process managers.\n\nYour task is to classify 5 fact type(s) from a provided list into one or more **Definitional Rule subtypes**, explain each classification in detail, and assign a confidence score ranging from 0 to 1.\n\n# Approach:\nUse the **Definitional Rule subtype definitions**, associated templates, and guidelines to analyze each statement thoroughly, ensuring accurate classification.\n\n---\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Classify the Statement**:\n   - For each `statement_text`, determine its rule subtype according to the provided **Definitional Rule subtypes** and their corresponding templates.\n   - Use the provided templates, definitions, and examples to match the statement to the correct subtype.\n   - If the statement does not align with a high-level type, analyze the sublevels.\n   - The subtype to be used starts with \"subtype: <subtype name>\".\n   - You should assign a subtype and a template ID, make your best guess, justify your choice, and lower the confidence level if necessary.\n   - Templates and examples help identify subtypes.\n\n2. **Assign Confidence Level**:\n   - Assign a confidence score between **0 and 1** for each classification:\n     - **1** indicates a strong and clear match.\n     - Lower scores reflect weaker matches due to ambiguities or partial alignment.\n   - Consider both template alignment and the clarity of the statement's intent when assigning scores.\n   - Assign confidence scores to each class for the given statement, ensuring that no two classes receive the same score. If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates. Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas. Identifying definitional rules involves analyzing the formal descriptions, enumerations, relationships, and valid values of key concepts and their components within a system.\n\n### Formal term definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal term definition defines a particular business term in a formal manner. They are categorized as:\n\n#### Formal intensional definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal intensional definition defines the subject business term using an intensional definition: one that cites both a hypernym (a term that refers to a superset of the set referred to by the original term) and the characteristics that distinguish members of the set referred to by the original term.\n\n**Template ID**: T7\n\n**Template Explanation**: This template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <term 1> is the term being defined;\n2. \"of {a|an} <term 2>\" is only required if <term 1> is an attribute term;\n3. <term 3> is the hypernym of <term 1>;\n4. <qualifying clause> is used to state the characteristics that distinguish members of the set signified by <term 1> from members of the sets signified by other hyponyms of <term3>; the options for a <qualifying clause> are listed in subtemplate S14. \n\n\n**Rule Form**:\n```rule_form\n{A|An} <term 1>\n  {of

Formal extensional definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1.2\n\n**Definition**: A formal extensional definition defines the subject business term using an extensional definition: one that lists a complete set of hyponyms (terms that refer to subsets of the set referred to by the original term).\n\n**Template ID**: T8\n\n**Template Explanation**: This template has the following important options and placeholders:\n1. <term 1> is the term being defined;\n2. \"of {a|an} <term 2>\" is only required if <term 1> is an attribute term or role term;\n3. \"[<article><term 3>, or]\" is a list of the hyponyms making up the definition of <term 1>, the last two articles and terms in the list separated by \"or\" (or a comma and \"or\" if adhering to U.S. punctuation standards), and each other pair of articles and terms in the list separated by a comma;\n4. \"of that <term 2>\" is only required if <term 1> is an attribute term or role term; if it is used,\nthe term substituted in place of <term 2> after \"[<article> <term 3>, or]\" should be the same\nas the term substituted in place of <term 2> after <term 1>.\n\n\n**Rule Form**:\n```rule_form\n{A|An} <term 1>\n  {of {a|an} <term 2>| }\nis by

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates. Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas. Identifying definitional rules involves analyzing the formal descriptions, enumerations, relationships, and valid values of key concepts and their components within a system.\n\n### Formal term definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal term definition defines a particular business term in a formal manner.

        "content": "\nYou are an expert in **SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules)**, working for regulatory bodies, auditors, or process managers.\n\nYour task is to classify 5 fact type(s) from a provided list into one or more **Definitional Rule subtypes**, explain each classification in detail, and assign a confidence score ranging from 0 to 1.\n\n# Approach:\nUse the **Definitional Rule subtype definitions**, associated templates, and guidelines to analyze each statement thoroughly, ensuring accurate classification.\n\n---\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **Classify the Statement**:\n   - For each `statement_text`, determine its rule subtype according to the provided **Definitional Rule subtypes** and their corresponding templates.\n   - Use the provided templates, definitions, and examples to match the statement to the correct subtype.\n   - If the statement does not align with a high-level type, analyze the sublevels.\n   - The subtype to be used starts with \"subtype: <subtype name>\".\n   - You should assign a subtype and a template ID, make your best guess, justify your choice, and lower the confidence level if necessary.\n   - Templates and examples help identify subtypes.\n\n2. **Assign Confidence Level**:\n   - Assign a confidence score between **0 and 1** for each classification:\n     - **1** indicates a strong and clear match.\n     - Lower scores reflect weaker matches due to ambiguities or partial alignment.\n   - Consider both template alignment and the clarity of the statement's intent when assigning scores.\n   - Assign confidence scores to each class for the given statement, ensuring that no two classes receive the same score. If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates. Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas. Identifying definitional rules involves analyzing the formal descriptions, enumerations, relationships, and valid values of key concepts and their components within a system.\n\n### Formal term definitions\n\n**ID**: 9.2.1\n\n**Definition**: A formal term definition defines a particular business term in a formal manner.

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates. Definitional rules are constraints that specify how constructs used by an organization or industry are defined, including formal definitions of terms, valid value ranges, and calculation formulas.

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n\n3. **Provide an Explanation**:\n   - Provide a concise yet detailed explanation for the assigned classification.\n   - Justify the classification by referencing:\n     - Template structure.\n     - Terminology used in the statement.\n     - Specific conditions or context highlighted by the statement.\n   - Explicitly map the elements of the statement (e.g., terms, qualifying clauses, verb phrases, conditional clauses, etc.) to template components.\n\n---\n\n# Definitional Rule subtypes\n\n## Definitional rules\n\n**ID**: 9.2\n\n**Definition**: Definitional rules constrain how we define a construct created or used by the organization or the industry within which it operates.
