rule_statements:
  - symbols:
      - option-sets: "An option set is delimited by braces; each option within an option
          set is separated from its neighbor(s) by a bar: for example,
          '{a|an|the}'. For each option set that appears in a template, one and
          only one option must be selected: in this case, exactly one of 'a',
          'an', or 'the' must be included at that point in the template or
          subtemplate. An option set may include a null option: this is
          indicated by the fact that there is no text between the last bar
          symbol and the closing brace: for example, '{a|an|the |}'. This
          signifies that it is permitted to select null (or nothing) as an
          option: in other words, at most one of 'a', 'an', or 'the' maybe
          included at that point in the template, but nothing may be included if
          nothing is required at that point."
      - placeholders: "There are various places in a template where any term, verb
          phrase, etc. can be substituted. These places are denoted by enclosing
          a label in angle brackets, the label indicating the type of word or
          other symbol that may be substituted. There are five types of
          placeholders: term from the fact model; literal; verb phrase and
          preposition; Any placeholder (other than <verb phrase> or
          <preposition>) in which the designator is not underlined is associated
          with a subtemplate having the same designator before the symbol
          '::='."
      - list-definitions: Where a syntactic element may be repeated indefinitely, this
          is denoted in a template by a list definition, consisting of a pair of
          square brackets enclosing the repeated syntactic element and the word
          to be used between repetitions.
      - boilerplate-text: Any text outside the option sets, placeholders, and list
          definitions in a template are boilerplate, to be included in all rule
          statements based on that template.
  - subtemplates:
      - S1: |
          <operative rule statement subject>::=
          {<term>|combination of [<term>, and]|set of <term>}
          {<qualifying clause>|}
      - S2: |
          <article>::={a |an|the}
      - S3: |
          <cardinality>::=
          {exactly|at least {<positive integer 1> and at most| }}
          <positive integer 2>
