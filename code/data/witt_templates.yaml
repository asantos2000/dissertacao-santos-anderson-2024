      Much the same conditions apply to the use of each option or placeholder as in template T27. Note that, if only one day of the week is permitted, use <literal 1>, otherwise list the days of the week separated by commas (with the last two day names in the list separated by ‘or’ or, if adhering to U.S. punctuation conventions, a comma and ‘or’);
      The same conditions also apply as in template T27 regarding the fact types that should be present in the fact model.

      1. <spatial term 1> is the name of the spatial data item whose values are constrained;
      2. if ‘must’ is not followed by ‘not’, ‘Each’ is required if that data item can appear more than once in an instance of the transaction or subform, whereas ‘The’ is required if that data item can appear only once in an instance of the transaction or subform;
      3. if ‘must’ is followed by ‘not’, ‘A’ or ‘An’ is required;
      4. ‘(if any)’ is required if and only if the data item is optional;
      5. the <spatial operator> placeholder can be replaced by anything defined in the subtemplate.

  - id: "T43"
    explanation: |
      Much the same conditions apply to the use of each option or placeholder as in template T27. In addition:
      1. ‘represented using’ should be included in the rule statement if the data type is one that admits different representations: for example, the same date can be represented as ‘25/12/2011’, ‘12/25/2011’, or ‘25 December 2011’;
      2. <term> must be defined in a standard format definition. The same conditions also apply as in template T27 regarding the fact types that should be present in the fact model.

      <transaction signifier 1> is the term used for the transaction (paper or electronic form or message) or persistent data record which is not allowed to be updated while <transaction signifier 2> is the term used for those objects to which <transaction signifier 1> refers; options for <transaction signifier> are listed in subtemplate S8; There should be a fact type connecting the principal term in each transaction signifier, although the verb phrase in that fact type does not appear in this type of rule statement.

      1. <subject term> is the term used for the parties or things that are the focus of the activity;
      2. <qualifying clause> is used if not every instance of <subject term> is subject to the rule; the options for <qualifying clause> are listed in subtemplate S14;
      3. <verb phrase> is followed by <object> if transitive (e.g., ‘board’, ‘undergo’) but not if intransitive (e.g., ‘be deleted’);
      4. <time restriction> is used if the activity is prohibited unless some other activity or event has previously occurred, whereas ‘if <conditional clause>’ is used if the activity is prohibited unless some prerequisite condition exists; the options for <time restriction> are listed in subtemplate S21, while the options for <conditional clause> are listed in subtemplate S13.
