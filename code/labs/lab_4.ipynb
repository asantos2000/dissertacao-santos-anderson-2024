    "\n",
    "In examining the classification of terms, names, fact types, and rules within business systems, key distinctions arise between definitional and operative rules, as well as in the structuring of term definitions. Terms, names, and fact types are foundational elements in the taxonomy of definitional rules, though they are not rules themselves. Instead, they serve as the core vocabulary for creating precise definitions and facilitating the rule-making process within an organization. Terms represent general concepts or classes, names uniquely identify specific instances or entities, and fact types capture relationships between terms. Together, these elements enable the consistent and unambiguous use of language across rule statements, models, and documentation, ensuring that definitional and operative rules function cohesively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitional rules aim to provide precise structures for organizational concepts, establishing clear, logical statements that support consistent interpretation and application of business language. These rules formalize term definitions, establish categorization schemes, and delineate relationships using fact types, which are classified by their structure as unary, binary, or higher-order and allow organizations to express relationships from simple Boolean properties to complex multi-term associations. When structured through definitional rule templates, fact types enhance clarity, facilitate shared understanding, and ensure accurate application within organizational rules, while supporting a conceptual backbone for business definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Names function as unique identifiers for specific instances or entities, adding precision to rule statements that require exact identification. Embedded within definitional rules, names provide specific references crucial for rules that depend on individual entities, distinguishing them from broader terms and reducing ambiguity in complex business contexts. Through structured templates within the definitional rule taxonomy, organizations can integrate names with uniformity and clarity, allowing for reliable reference to distinct entities within rule statements and models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Operative rules, on the other hand, govern actionable requirements, setting conditions under which actions must or must not occur. These include data, activity, and party rules, each ensuring compliance, standardization, and procedural integrity across business processes. Operative rules provide the necessary conditions for maintaining organizational consistency, detailing what actions are authorized in particular circumstances or specifying roles within defined tasks, thereby aligning processes with business objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "To formalize term definitions, expressions must adhere to specific templates within the definitional rule taxonomy, which clearly articulate each term's scope, meaning, and responsibilities. For instance, the term \"Commission\" can be formally defined within Template T7, part of the definitional rule taxonomy, to clarify its procedural functions as the entity that receives and forwards legal documents. By using templates for definitional rules, organizations achieve consistent, unambiguous documentation of terms, fact types, and names, which minimizes ambiguity and ensures standardized interpretation across all business contexts. This structured approach supports precise rule governance and enhances communication within organizational processes, reinforcing the integrity and reliability of rule-based systems."

      "Each formulation is expressed using a template, in which the various symbols have the following meanings:\n",
      "1. Each item enclosed in “angle brackets” (\"<\" and \">\") is a placeholder, in place of which any suitable text may be substituted. For example, any of the following may be substituted in place of <operative rule statement subject>:\n",
      "    a. a term: for example, \"flight booking request\",\n",
      "    b. a term followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"flight booking request for a one-way journey\",\n",
      "    c. a reference to a combination of items: for example, \"combination of enrollment date and graduation date\", with or without a qualifying clause,\n",
      "    d. a reference to a set of items: for example, \"set of passengers\", with or without a qualifying clause.\n",
      "2. Each pair of braces (\"{\" and \"}\") encloses a set of options (separated from each other by the bar symbol: \"|\"), one of which is included in the rule statement. For example,\n",
      "    a. each rule statement conforming to formulation T1, T3, or T4 starts with either \"Each\" or \"The\";\n",
      "    b. a conditional clause in a rule statement conforming to formulation T1, T2, or T4 is preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n",
      "3. If a pair of braces includes a bar symbol immediately before the closing brace, the null option is allowed: that is, you can, if necessary, include none of the options at that point in the rule statement. For example, each rule statement conforming to formulation T1, T2, or T4 may include or omit a conditional clause preceded by \"if\" or \"unless\".\n",
      "4. Sets of options may be nested. For example, in each of the templates above\n",
      "    a. a conditional clause may be included or omitted,\n",
      "    b. if included, the conditional clause should be preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n",

      "Each formulation is expressed using a template, in which the various symbols have the following meanings:\n",
      "1. Each item enclosed in “angle brackets” (\"<\" and \">\") is a placeholder, in place of which any suitable text may be substituted. For example, any of the following may be substituted in place of <operative rule statement subject>:\n",
      "    a. a term: for example, \"flight booking request\",\n",
      "    b. a term followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"flight booking request for a one-way journey\",\n",
      "    c. a reference to a combination of items: for example, \"combination of enrollment date and graduation date\", with or without a qualifying clause,\n",
      "    d. a reference to a set of items: for example, \"set of passengers\", with or without a qualifying clause.\n",
      "2. Each pair of braces (\"{\" and \"}\") encloses a set of options (separated from each other by the bar symbol: \"|\"), one of which is included in the rule statement. For example,\n",
      "    a. each rule statement conforming to formulation T1, T3, or T4 starts with either \"Each\" or \"The\";\n",
      "    b. a conditional clause in a rule statement conforming to formulation T1, T2, or T4 is preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n",
      "3. If a pair of braces includes a bar symbol immediately before the closing brace, the null option is allowed: that is, you can, if necessary, include none of the options at that point in the rule statement. For example, each rule statement conforming to formulation T1, T2, or T4 may include or omit a conditional clause preceded by \"if\" or \"unless\".\n",
      "4. Sets of options may be nested. For example, in each of the templates above\n",
      "    a. a conditional clause may be included or omitted,\n",
      "    b. if included, the conditional clause should be preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n",

      "Each formulation is expressed using a template, in which the various symbols have the following meanings:\n",
      "1. Each item enclosed in “angle brackets” (\"<\" and \">\") is a placeholder, in place of which any suitable text may be substituted. For example, any of the following may be substituted in place of <operative rule statement subject>:\n",
      "    a. a term: for example, \"flight booking request\",\n",
      "    b. a term followed by a qualifying clause: for example, \"flight booking request for a one-way journey\",\n",
      "    c. a reference to a combination of items: for example, \"combination of enrollment date and graduation date\", with or without a qualifying clause,\n",
      "    d. a reference to a set of items: for example, \"set of passengers\", with or without a qualifying clause.\n",
      "2. Each pair of braces (\"{\" and \"}\") encloses a set of options (separated from each other by the bar symbol: \"|\"), one of which is included in the rule statement. For example,\n",
      "    a. each rule statement conforming to formulation T1, T3, or T4 starts with either \"Each\" or \"The\";\n",
      "    b. a conditional clause in a rule statement conforming to formulation T1, T2, or T4 is preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n",
      "3. If a pair of braces includes a bar symbol immediately before the closing brace, the null option is allowed: that is, you can, if necessary, include none of the options at that point in the rule statement. For example, each rule statement conforming to formulation T1, T2, or T4 may include or omit a conditional clause preceded by \"if\" or \"unless\".\n",
      "4. Sets of options may be nested. For example, in each of the templates above\n",
      "    a. a conditional clause may be included or omitted,\n",
      "    b. if included, the conditional clause should be preceded by either \"if\" or \"unless\".\n",
      "5. A further notation, introduced later in this section, uses square brackets to indicate that a syntactic element may be repeated indefinitely.\n",

    "For the the first parte (prompt_classify_p1), the assigned confidence levels reflect a calibrated approach to expressions involving multiple classifications where a dominant rule type is not explicitly evident. For instance, when an expression primarily constrains data (Data rule) but also includes specific parties (Party rule), a high confidence level is attributed to Data while a moderate confidence level is applied to Party, acknowledging its secondary relevance. Similarly, expressions referencing roles such as “Secretary” or “interested person” without explicit party restrictions are assigned moderate confidence for Party classification due to interpretive ambiguity. Procedural elements that impact data handling, such as document forwarding, receive high confidence for Data rules; however, a moderate confidence level is assigned for Activity rules when procedural references are indirect. This methodology prioritizes primary rule types while accounting for the interpretive limits of secondary classifications."
