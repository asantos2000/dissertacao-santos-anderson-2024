        "\n",
        "#### Steps to Perform:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Identify Facts and Fact Types**:\n",
        "   - A **fact** is a specific instance or statement that describes an event or condition.\n",

        "   - For each fact or fact type:\n",
        "     - Extract the **expression** that represents the fact or fact type.\n",
        "     - List the **terms** (Nouns or Proper nouns) involved in the fact or fact type.\n",
        "     - Identify the **fact symbols** (verbs, verb phrases, or prepositions) connecting the terms.\n",
        "     - Classify the expression as either a **Fact** or **Fact Type**.\n",
        "     - Note the section or paragraph where the fact or fact type appears as the **source**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Classify Terms**:\n",
        "   - For each fact or fact type, classify all **terms**:\n",
        "     - Label each term as either a **Noun** or **Proper Noun**.\n",
        "   - Ensure that the terms are extracted accurately and classified correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Define term**:\n",
        "   - For each term look in the document for the term definition. If the term definition is not found, use \"missing\".:\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Identify Fact Symbols**:\n",
        "   - Extract the verbs or prepositions that define the relationships between the terms. These are referred to as **fact symbols**.\n",
        "   - Each fact or fact type should have a list of fact symbols.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Source Information**:\n",
        "   - Record the paragraph or section of the document where each fact or fact type is found as **source** information (e.g., “(a)(1)”, “(b)”).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Recognize Term Relationships**:\n",

        "     - **Hypernym-Hyponym**: A broader term (hypernym) that includes a more specific term (hyponym).\n",

        "     - Ensure that both terms involved in the relationship are valid terms from the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Structure the Output in JSON Format**:\n",
        "   - Create a JSON object with the following structure:\n",
        "     - **facts_and_fact_types**: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains:\n",
        "       - **id**: A unique identifier for the fact or fact type.\n",
        "       - **expression**: The extracted fact or fact type.\n",
        "       - **terms**: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has a term and its classification (either \"Noun\" or \"Proper Noun\").\n",
        "       - **fact_symbols**: A list of verb phrases or prepositions connecting the terms.\n",
        "       - **classification**: Either \"Fact\" or \"Fact Type\".\n",
        "       - **source**: The section or paragraph where the fact or fact type appears.\n",

It specifies what must be done or what is not allowed, often guiding actions, decisions, and behaviors within an organization. Rules enforce compliance, limit possibilities, or prescribe specific behaviors in response to business situations. e.g., \"A customer must provide identification before opening an account.\".\n",

        "1. **Summarize the document**:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Identify Facts, Fact Types, and Rules**:\n",
        "   - **Definitions**:\n",
        "     - **Fact**: A specific instance or statement that describes an event or condition without any directive element. Facts often involve relationships between terms or entities. Example: \"John works for X Inc.\"\n",
        "     - **Fact Type**: A general, abstract template that describes potential relationships between terms or entities, serving as a model for generating specific facts. Example: \"Person works for Company.\"\n",
        "     - **Rule**: A statement that governs or constrains some aspect of the business, specifying what must be done or what is not allowed. Rules enforce compliance, limit possibilities, or prescribe specific behaviors in response to business situations. Example: \"A customer must provide identification before opening an account.\"\n",
        "   - **For each fact, fact type, or rule**:\n",
        "     - **Extract the Expression**: Identify the exact sentence or phrase from the document representing the fact, fact type, or rule.\n",
        "     - **Extract Terms**: List all the terms involved in the expression.\n",
        "     - **Extract Verb Symbols**: Identify verbs, verb phrases, or prepositions that connect the terms in the expression.\n",
        "     - **Classification**: Classify the expression as either a **Fact**, **Fact Type**, or **Rule**.\n",
        "     - **Source**: Note the specific paragraph or section of the document where the expression is found (e.g., \"(a)(1)\", \"(b)\").\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Classify Terms**:\n",
        "   - For each term extracted classify it as either a **Common Noun** or a **Proper Noun**.\n",

        "4. **Define Terms**:\n",

        "     - **Synonym**: Terms that can be used interchangeably without changing the meaning.\n",
        "     - **Hypernym-Hyponym**: A broader term (hypernym) that includes a more specific term (hyponym).\n",
        "   - **For each pair of terms in the document**:\n",
        "     - Identify if a relationship exists as either \"Synonym\" or \"Hypernym-Hyponym\".\n",

        "     - **Fact Type**: A general, abstract template that describes potential relationships between terms or entities, serving as a model for generating specific facts. Example: \"Person works for Company.\"\n",
        "     - **Rule**: A statement that governs or constrains some aspect of the business, specifying what must be done or what is not allowed. Rules enforce compliance, limit possibilities, or prescribe specific behaviors in response to business situations. Example: \"A customer must provide identification before opening an account.\"\n",
        "     - **Term**: A word or a group of words that represents a specific concept, entity, or subject in a particular context.\n",
        "   - **For each fact, fact type, or rule**:\n",
        "     - **Extract the Expression**: Identify the exact sentence or phrase from the document representing the fact, fact type, or rule.\n",

        "     - **Extract Verb Symbols**: Identify verbs, verb phrases, or prepositions that connect the terms in the expression.\n",
