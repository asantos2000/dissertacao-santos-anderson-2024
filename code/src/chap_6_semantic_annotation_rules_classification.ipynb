    "In examining the classification of terms, names, fact types, and rules within business systems, key distinctions arise between definitional and operative rules, as well as in the structuring of term definitions. Terms, names, and fact types are foundational elements in the taxonomy of definitional rules, though they are not rules themselves. Instead, they serve as the core vocabulary for creating precise definitions and facilitating the rule-making process within an organization. Terms represent general concepts or classes, names uniquely identify specific instances or entities, and fact types capture relationships between terms. Together, these elements enable the consistent and unambiguous use of language across rule statements, models, and documentation, ensuring that definitional and operative rules function cohesively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitional rules aim to provide precise structures for organizational concepts, establishing clear, logical statements that support consistent interpretation and application of business language. These rules formalize term definitions, establish categorization schemes, and delineate relationships using fact types, which are classified by their structure as unary, binary, or higher-order and allow organizations to express relationships from simple Boolean properties to complex multi-term associations. When structured through definitional rule templates, fact types enhance clarity, facilitate shared understanding, and ensure accurate application within organizational rules, while supporting a conceptual backbone for business definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Names function as unique identifiers for specific instances or entities, adding precision to rule statements that require exact identification. Embedded within definitional rules, names provide specific references crucial for rules that depend on individual entities, distinguishing them from broader terms and reducing ambiguity in complex business contexts. Through structured templates within the definitional rule taxonomy, organizations can integrate names with uniformity and clarity, allowing for reliable reference to distinct entities within rule statements and models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Operative rules, on the other hand, govern actionable requirements, setting conditions under which actions must or must not occur. These include data, activity, and party rules, each ensuring compliance, standardization, and procedural integrity across business processes. Operative rules provide the necessary conditions for maintaining organizational consistency, detailing what actions are authorized in particular circumstances or specifying roles within defined tasks, thereby aligning processes with business objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "To formalize term definitions, statements must adhere to specific templates within the definitional rule taxonomy, which clearly articulate each term's scope, meaning, and responsibilities. For instance, the term \"Commission\" can be formally defined within Template T7, part of the definitional rule taxonomy, to clarify its procedural functions as the entity that receives and forwards legal documents. By using templates for definitional rules, organizations achieve consistent, unambiguous documentation of terms, fact types, and names, which minimizes ambiguity and ensures standardized interpretation across all business contexts. This structured approach supports precise rule governance and enhances communication within organizational processes, reinforcing the integrity and reliability of rule-based systems."

    "Your task is to classify each statement into one or more Operative Rules types according to the given definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Summarize statement**: Summarize the given statement to understand its structure and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Classify statement**: Classify each Operative Rule statement into one or more of the provided rule types. The **Operative rules** govern actions or constraints that must or must not happen under certain conditions, such as Data Rules, Activity Rules, and Party Rules. types to classify are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Party rules**: A \"Party rule\" is a type of operative rule that establishes distinctions or constraints involving parties or the roles they perform. To identify a party rule, it is important to recognize its defining characteristics, as these rules often specify who can carry out certain activities, access particular information, or hold specific responsibilities. Party rules may include restrictions on who is permitted to perform specific roles or processes. For example, a rule might state that a person can serve as the pilot in command only if they hold a current command endorsement. Additionally, these rules may enforce role separation to prevent conflicts of interest, such as a requirement that the cabin crew member verifying an aircraft door's disarmed status cannot be the same individual who initially disarmed it. In other cases, party rules may require role binding, ensuring continuity by stipulating that the consultant who signs a quality review report must be the one who conducted the review. Party rules can also govern information access, specifying who is authorized to view, create, or modify certain data. For instance, a rule might state that an employee’s leave record can only be accessed by the employee, their supervisor, or a human resources officer. Furthermore, responsibility rules fall under this category by defining accountability for specific actions or obligations, such as requiring the receiving parties in a property transfer to pay the associated stamp duty. These rules can be identified by linking actions or processes (predicates) to subjects, like roles or data, while applying conditions that qualify or limit their application. \n",
    "- **Data rules**: A \"Data rule\" imposes constraints or requirements on the data used in transactions, records, or systems. Identifying a data rule involves analyzing its structure, purpose, and type, which include cardinality, content, and update rules. Data cardinality rules govern the presence and multiplicity of data items. These may include mandatory rules requiring data items, such as specifying at least one passenger name in a flight booking confirmation. They can also restrict data, such as ensuring a one-way flight booking does not include a return date, or enforce limits on the number of data instances in a transaction. Data content rules regulate the values within data items. Examples include value set rules, which require a data item to match one of a specified set of valid values, and range rules that constrain a data item's value to within a specific range. Equality rules ensure consistency between related data items, such as requiring that an origin city matches the corresponding booking request. Additionally, uniqueness constraints ensure that a data item's value does not duplicate within a dataset, and consistency rules maintain logical relationships between multiple data points. Lastly, data update rules constrain modifications to existing data. These rules may prohibit updates entirely, restrict the scope of permissible changes (such as maintaining valid state transitions), or enforce monotonic trends like numeric values that can only increase or decrease. To identify a data rule, it is essential to examine the specific constraints or requirements applied to data items, their interrelationships, and their contexts within a given system or transaction. Templates and formalized structures, can aid in distinguishing these rules effectively.\n",
    "- **Activity rules**: An \"Activity rule\" is an operative rule designed to constrain the operation of business processes or activities. Identifying an activity rule involves understanding its subcategories, which define how activities are regulated or mandated. The primary types of activity rules are activity restriction rules, activity obligation rules, and process decision rules. Activity restriction rules are used to place limitations on when or under what conditions an activity can occur. For example, time-based restrictions may stipulate that online check-in for a flight can only occur within a specific time window, such as the 24 hours before departure. Similarly, exclusion period rules prohibit activities during certain times, such as a restriction on operating machinery during nighttime hours. Activity pre-condition rules ensure that an event must occur before another activity can take place, such as requiring passengers to complete a security screening before boarding. Activity obligation rules, on the other hand, specify activities that must be performed either within a maximum time after a triggering event or as soon as practical. For instance, acknowledging an order may be mandated to occur within 24 hours of receipt. These rules enforce timely action and compliance with operational requirements. Process decision rules determine actions in response to specific situations. These rules guide devices or processes, such as ensuring that a ticket barrier retains invalid tickets to prevent misuse. To identify an activity rule, it is essential to look for statements that define constraints, obligations, or decision-making criteria for activities. Such rules are often structured using specific templates that articulate the conditions, timeframes, or triggers associated with the activity. Recognizing these elements helps in categorizing activity rules effectively.\n",

If one class is assigned a score (e.g., 0.6), the others must have distinct values that are either higher or lower. The scores should reflect the likelihood of each class while avoiding ties.\n",

    "##### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification of the given statement initially had a lower confidence level because it could be interpreted from two distinct perspectives: a **party rule** or a **data consistency rule**. A **party rule** focuses on procedural governance and accountability, emphasizing the roles, responsibilities, and authority of individuals—in this case, the Secretary, whose certification serves as evidence of service. This perspective is crucial when considering formal roles, defining valid actions, and ensuring compliance, which makes it more fitting for scenarios involving regulatory oversight, accountability, and process management.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **data consistency rule** perspective, on the other hand, considers the relationship between different data elements—here, the certification and document forwarding—and aims to ensure logical consistency between these elements. This classification fits more technical or data-centric contexts, such as ensuring the integrity of records. However, with the prompt specifying a focus on regulatory bodies, auditors, or process managers, the interpretation naturally shifts toward the **party rule** classification. Consequently, the confidence in this classification increases, as it directly aligns with the needs of those focused on governance, responsibility, and ensuring procedural correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Opsahl-Ong et al. (2024) small changes in the prompt affect the outcome because language models are highly sensitive to the structure and context of the instructions. Minimal alterations in word choice, sentence order, or tone can lead the model to interpret the task differently, as it relies on statistical correlations and previously observed patterns. In multi-stage pipelines, this is even more critical, as a change in one module can create a cascading effect, impacting the results of subsequent stages. This sensitivity makes precise prompt adjustments essential to achieve the desired performance in specific tasks."

    "In the first prompt (prompt_classify_p1), the confidence levels assigned reflect the absence of a dominant classification. For example, when a statement primarily restricts data (data rule) but also includes specific roles (party rule), a high level of confidence is assigned to the data while a moderate level of confidence is applied to the party, recognizing its secondary relevance. Similarly, statements that reference roles such as \"Secretary\" or \"interested person\" without explicit party restrictions receive moderate confidence for party classification due to ambiguity in interpretation. Procedural elements that impact data handling, such as document routing, receive high confidence for data rules; however, a moderate level of confidence is assigned to activity rules when procedural references are indirect.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this behavior was the classification of the sentence: “If the Secretary certifies that the Commission has received proceedings, petitions, or other documents under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and forwarded those documents to a party designated by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, such certification constitutes evidence of service to that party.” The first classification (classify_P1) had low confidence because the sentence admits two interpretations: party rule or data consistency rule. The role rule focuses on governance and accountability, highlighting the roles of individuals, such as the Secretary, whose certification serves as evidence of service. The data consistency perspective considers the relationship between data elements, evolving the logical consistency between them, such as certification and forwarding of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the prompt did not specify the focus, which led to the choice of the technical perspective (data) and caused problems in the second classification, where the LLM could not find an appropriate category (sublevel) in the taxonomy. With the addition of the sentence “You are working for regulators, auditors, or process managers.” interpretation has shifted to part rule classification, increasing confidence, consistency in classification, and locating a classification in the taxonomy sublevel (classify_P2_operative_rule) - Responsibility rules."
